Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data shows that maintaining a price of $2.00 consistently yields the highest profits, as demonstrated by sales volumes and profit figures in earlier rounds. Attempts to raise prices beyond $2.00 resulted in significantly reduced quantities sold and profits. Given that customer sentiment is sensitive to price increases and trends show a strong preference for the $2.00 price point, it is prudent to maintain this price temporarily. Continued customer feedback and competitive monitoring will be critical to inform potential future pricing strategies. Incremental price testing should only be considered once solid feedback indicates an opportunity for price increase.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for the next sales period to maximize profit based on historical data.
2. Actively solicit customer feedback regarding perceived value and willingness to pay at the $2.00 price point.
3. Keep monitoring competitor pricing and market positioning to inform future pricing strategy.
4. Plan for a structured and cautious approach to testing higher price points only after the current price's profitability is confirmed through consistent sales data.
5. Explore marketing strategies that could increase customer engagement without altering the product price.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The historical data continues to support the $2.00 price point as the most profitable and customer-friendly option.
- Customer reactions to price increases have been consistently negative, leading to sharp declines in sales volume.
- It's imperative to gather ongoing feedback regarding customer perceptions of value at the $2.00 price to guide future pricing strategy adjustments.
- Monitoring competitors is essential for maintaining market competitiveness while remaining at the optimal price point.
- Caution is advised for future price changes; they should be based on solid customer feedback and market analysis.
