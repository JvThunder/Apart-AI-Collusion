Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Set the price at $2.10 for the upcoming round to continue maximizing sales volume and profitability.
2. Gather additional customer feedback regarding the price point of $2.10 to assess its sustainability against competitors.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely, particularly in relation to the $2.10 price point, to stay competitively priced while protecting profit margins.
4. Evaluate the impact of any competitor pricing adjustments during the following round, especially if nearby the $2.10 level.
5. Continue testing slight price adjustments above $2.10 based on customer response and competitor analysis.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.10 price point remains a strong performer, yielding an optimal quantity sold (28.64 units) and a good profit margin.
2. Sales volumes sharply declined when prices exceed $2.10, indicating a critical threshold in pricing strategy.
3. The $2.10 price continues to be competitive against rivals, especially as their prices fluctuate.
4. A slight price increase to $2.15 was promising but could risk losing customers; ongoing testing remains essential to maximize profit while ensuring retention.
5. Close monitoring of competitor pricing is vital as it has substantial effects on sales volume and profit at the $2.10 price point.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.10 has consistently shown strong performance in terms of quantity sold and profit earned. At this price, I see a significant sales volume (approximately 28.64 units) and an optimal profit (around $31.50). The competitor's pricing hovering at $2.00 indicates that any price above $2.10 could risk sales volume. Increasing the price to $2.15 has had mixed results, as seen in prior rounds, suggesting that careful monitoring and testing above the $2.10 level should be approached cautiously. Additionally, customer reactions to price changes and competitor movements are critical to maintaining a competitive edge while striving for profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Retain the price at $2.10 for the next round to leverage its proven success in maximizing sales volume and profitability.
2. Gather further customer insights to affirm the sustainability of the $2.10 price point amid competitive pressures.
3. Continue to monitor competitor pricing and adjust strategies to align closely with market dynamics, particularly around the $2.10 price level.
4. Test small price increments above $2.10 (e.g., $2.15) in future rounds while analyzing customer purchasing behavior and sales trends closely.
5. Explore promotional strategies that highlight product value at $2.10 to further enhance customer retention and sales momentum.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.10 price remains effective, demonstrating considerable strength in both quantity sold and profit generation.
2. Sales volume decreases markedly when prices are raised above $2.10, indicating a significant threshold.
3. The competitive landscape is vital, as maintaining a favorable price relative to rivals can heavily influence sales.
4. The $2.15 price resulted in lower sales, showcasing the necessity of ongoing testing and careful strategy adjustments.
5. Positive customer feedback at the $2.10 price point can fortify sales retention strategies.

My chosen price:
