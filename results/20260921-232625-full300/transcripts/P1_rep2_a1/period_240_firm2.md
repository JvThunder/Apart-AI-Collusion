Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Adjust the price to $1.95 to maximize sales volume and profitability.
2. Monitor customer responses and analyze profitability at this price point.
3. Evaluate promotional efforts implemented to support pricing at $1.95.
4. Observe competitor pricing closely, especially when they are near $1.90 or $1.95, and adjust strategies as needed.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. A price of $1.95 has consistently demonstrated strong sales volume and overall profitability, making it an optimal price point.
2. Competitive pricing pressures necessitate maintaining a price below or at $1.95 to remain attractive to customers.
3. Continuing to monitor competitor pricing can provide opportunities to further adjust strategy for maximum profitability.
4. Observational data indicates that lowering price from $2.00 to $1.95 increases overall sales and profitability, suggesting potential for increased market share.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The previous market data indicates that a price of $1.95 is consistently yielding a strong sales volume and profitability, often leading to a profit around $31.25 to $33.70, showing that it has the potential to be a profit-maximizing price. Lowering the price to $1.95 has resulted in higher sales volume compared to higher price points (like $2.10). Given the competitor pricing data, setting the price at $1.95 will keep my offerings competitive while maximizing sales and profit. Competitor reactions should continually be monitored, especially when prices fluctuate near my price point.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $1.95 to maximize sales volume and profitability.
2. Monitor customer responses and analyze profitability regularly at this price point.
3. Implement promotional efforts to enhance visibility at the $1.95 price point.
4. Continuously observe competitor pricing trends, adjusting my strategy if needed to maintain competitiveness.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. A price of $1.95 has consistently demonstrated strong sales volume and profitability, making it an optimal price point.
2. Lowering the price from $2.10 to $1.95 has shown significant increases in quantity sold and overall profit, indicating a strategic advantage in market share.
3. Keeping an eye on competitors’ pricing is crucial for adjusting strategies effectively to ensure remaining attractive to customers.
4. Positive customer responses to price adjustments towards $1.95, with a consistently high profit margin over production costs, reinforces its potential as a sustainably profitable price point.

My chosen price:
