Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue monitoring the existing price of $1.95 for another two weeks to gather additional sales data, assessing the sales impact on quantity sold.
2. Implement a temporary price strategy of $1.90 for an additional two weeks to maximize sales volume while monitoring the resulting profit.
3. After the promotional period at $1.90, conduct a customer feedback survey to assess sentiment and price elasticity.
4. Begin testing a gradual price increase to $2.05 while monitoring customer response and sales volume to evaluate the potential for increased profitability.
5. Keep a vigilant eye on competitor pricing strategies and market conditions, adapting our pricing model accordingly.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data indicates that pricing at $1.90 has resulted in higher sales volumes and consequently higher profits. The price point of $1.95 has also shown solid performance but at a lower volume than $1.90. Currently, the price of $2.00 demonstrates good stability in sustained profits, but the profit metrics observed are not maximized in terms of sales volume compared to lower price points. With competitor pricing being close to these price points, there's still an opportunity to adjust accordingly without losing market position. Additionally, customer sentiment around pricing and price sensitivity shows that even small adjustments can have significant impacts on quantity sold. I suggest testing both $1.90 and $2.05 as strategic price points in the upcoming weeks to gather more data for analysis.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Implement a temporary price strategy of $1.90 for the next two weeks to maximize sales volume and gather further profit data.
2. Gradually test a price increase to $2.05 while monitoring the response in sales volume to assess the potential for increased profitability.
3. Conduct a customer feedback survey after the temporary promotional period at $1.90 to evaluate sentiment and price elasticity.
4. Continue monitoring competitors' pricing strategies and adjust our pricing model based on market conditions and price sensitivity data gathered from customers.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $1.90 has shown positive results in increasing sales volume and has the potential to enhance profitability due to higher unit sales.
- Pricing at $2.00 has provided stability in profit but does not maximize volume as effectively as $1.90.
- Customer feedback is crucial for fine-tuning pricing strategies and understanding their price sensitivity, especially around critical price points.
- Competitor monitoring at higher price points is essential for maintaining our competitive edge while exploring higher pricing strategies above $2.00.

My chosen price:
1.90
