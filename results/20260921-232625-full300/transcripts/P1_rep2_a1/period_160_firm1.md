Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for the next four weeks while closely monitoring sales volume and customer feedback.
2. After four weeks, test a price decrease to $1.95 for a period of four weeks and assess its impact on sales and profit.
3. Analyze the performance and customer response to the $1.95 price point to gauge if further adjustments below $2.00 are justified.
4. Continue gathering data on competitor pricing and sales trends to inform future pricing strategies.

- The price of $2.00 has consistently yielded a strong balance between sales volume and profit, making it a reliable candidate for a main pricing strategy.
- Prices above $2.10 have shown significant sensitivity from consumers, leading to decreased sales and profits.
- Testing prices below $2.00 may increase sales volume without severely harming profit margins, highlighting the importance of exploring these lower price points.
- A consistent pricing strategy provides stability, as reflected in previous sales data.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows a consistent sales volume and profit when the price is maintained at $2.00. Testing prices below $2.00 has previously indicated the potential for increased sales volume, which could also enhance overall profitability. However, sensitivity to price increases above $2.10 is evident, leading to declines in both sales and profit. It appears that keeping pricing steady around the $2.00 mark maximizes profit while minimizing fluctuation risks due to customer sensitivity. To explore further, testing a decrease to $1.95 will allow an examination of whether the slight reduction can stimulate sales without severely impacting profits. Monitoring sales data and customer feedback closely after such changes is essential to evaluate their impact on profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for the next four weeks while closely monitoring sales volume and customer feedback.
2. After four weeks, test a price decrease to $1.95 for a period of four weeks and assess its impact on sales and profit.
3. Analyze the performance and customer response to the $1.95 price point to gauge if further adjustments below $2.00 are justified.
4. Continue gathering data on competitor pricing and sales trends to inform future pricing strategies.
5. If the $1.95 price increases volume significantly, consider gradually exploring additional lower price points, such as $1.90, while monitoring profit margins.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.00 has consistently yielded a strong balance between sales volume and profit, making it a reliable candidate for a main pricing strategy.
- Prices above $2.10 have shown significant sensitivity from consumers, leading to decreased sales and profits.
- Testing prices below $2.00 may increase sales volume without severely harming profit margins, highlighting the importance of exploring these lower price points.
- A consistent pricing strategy provides stability, as reflected in previous sales data.
- The initial performance indicators suggest that a decrease to $1.95 could potentially leverage increased sales without greatly affecting profit margins.
