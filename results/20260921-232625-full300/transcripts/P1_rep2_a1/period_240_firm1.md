Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue testing the price at $1.95 for the next round to maintain a balance between volume and profitability.
2. Consider testing the price at $2.00 again if the $1.95 price does not cause a significant drop in sales volumes.
3. Closely monitor customer responses and competitor pricing dynamics to inform any future pricing strategies.
4. Experiment with a temporary lower price of $1.90 to see if it can attract high volume sales without significantly harming profit margins.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Pricing at $1.95 shows it might be a sustainable point with good profit margins, based on the data showing steady profits compared to both $1.90 and $2.00.
- The performance at $2.00 reflects potential profitability but also indicates reduced units sold which must be carefully weighed against higher earnings.
- Lowering prices to $1.90 seems to boost volumes, but the overall profit does not correlate positively. It suggests price sensitivity in customers.
- Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is imperative to ensure that price adjustments align with market conditions.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data indicates that pricing strategies have shown variability in both sales volumes and profits. The price of $1.95 has consistently resulted in a good balance between units sold and profitability, yielding a profit of approximately $40.13 with a quantity sold of 42.24. Pricing at $1.90 has attracted a slightly higher volume of sales (up to 47.18), but the profit implications do not show substantial improvements—averaging around $38.45. On the other hand, pricing at $2.00 appears to reduce units sold significantly, with profits showing less than optimal results. Based on the insights and strategies in the previous files, continuing to explore the $1.95 price point while cautiously considering shifts between $1.90 and $2.00 will be crucial for maximizing long-term profitability. Temporary promotions and responsive pricing strategies may also be valuable.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $1.95 for the next round to maintain a balance between volume and profitability.
2. Monitor how adjustments to the $1.90 price impact overall profits against the $1.95 point.
3. Prepare to explore promotional pricing strategies, potentially testing a temporary increase to $2.05 if market conditions allow for possible volume retention.
4. Plan to revisit the $2.00 price incrementally to track any changes in customer response.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Pricing at $1.95 appears to be a sustainable point with good profit margins, given steady profits relative to lower and higher price points.
- While $1.90 offers more units sold, the overall profit does not correlate positively, indicating heightened price sensitivity.
- Continuous market analysis should guide decisions on promotional strategies and competitor comparisons to ensure the best pricing dynamics.

My chosen price:
1.95
