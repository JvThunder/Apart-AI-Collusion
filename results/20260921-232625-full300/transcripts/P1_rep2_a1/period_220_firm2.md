Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.73.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing the price of $2.05 for the next round and closely monitor quantity sold and customer feedback.
2. Compare results at $2.05 with previous rounds at $2.10, focusing on long-term customer purchase behavior.
3. Ensure regular observation of competitors’ pricing, specifically at $1.90 and below, to gauge the impact on our sales volume.
4. If sales volume remains robust at $2.05, consider slight price fluctuations (e.g., $2.00 or $2.10) for further testing in upcoming rounds.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy at $2.10 appears to be less effective compared to $2.05, as evidenced by the quantity sold and profit data. Customers seem to prefer lower prices, specifically around $2.05. Competitive pressures are evident with competitor prices being lower, sometimes as low as $1.90. There are even cases where a price of $2.00 yielded higher sales and profit, suggesting that adopting a more aggressive pricing strategy could optimize profitability. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is vital, especially as their prices fluctuate. Therefore, focusing on a pricing strategy that alternates between $2.00 and $2.05 may capitalize on both competitive pricing and consumer preference.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the price of $2.00 for the next round, monitoring the quantity sold and profit closely.
2. Maintain the price at $2.05 for comparison with $2.00, while regularly checking customer feedback.
3. Continue observing competitor pricing, particularly at prices of $1.90 and below, to gauge their impact on sales.
4. If $2.00 shows a positive trend in quantities sold and profits, consider testing $2.05 again after a suitable duration to assess customer response.
5. Document any significant shifts in purchasing behavior as a result of these price changes.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.05 has shown better sales volume potential compared to $2.10, indicating a customer preference for this price point.
2. A price of $2.00 yielded a considerable profit and higher quantity sold, suggesting that a lower price can attract more customers and increase overall profitability.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitors' prices is crucial, as they can significantly affect our sales volume.

My chosen price:
2.00
