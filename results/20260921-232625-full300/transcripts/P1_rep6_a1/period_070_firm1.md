Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue selling at $2.05 for an additional two weeks to monitor customer retention and sales volume while collecting feedback on perceived value.
2. Conduct a survey to gather specific customer feedback on their willingness to pay above $2.05, exploring a higher range up to $2.15.
3. Test an increase to $2.10 in the following month while closely observing the effect on sales volume and profit.
4. If positive feedback and data support this, consider testing $2.15 to see if profitability can be maintained.
5. Reassess the competitive landscape regularly to ensure that pricing remains attractive compared to competitors while still optimizing profit margins.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. Selling at $2.05 balances customer demand and profit, providing consistent sales volume.
2. Customers show moderate sensitivity to price increases, with notable declines in quantity sold when prices exceed $2.10.
3. Direct customer feedback regarding willingness to pay is essential for assessing potential price increases.
4. Long-term stability at a price point should be tested before making drastic adjustments to ensure sustained profit levels.
5. It is essential to remain aligned with competitors' strategies to maintain a competitive advantage while maximizing profitability.
6. A slight price increase can be tested to gauge customer reaction and potential impact on sales volume.
7. Customer feedback will inform potential price increase strategies that could optimize profit margins.
8. The observed price elasticity suggests that caution is necessary with any price increases.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the previous pricing strategies and sales data, it is clear that increasing the price tends to affect sales volume significantly. The best price observed was $2.05, which yields consistent profits without drastic decreases in quantity sold. A price of $2.10 begins to reduce sales significantly, while $2.15 created a larger drop in quantity sold. Given the observed price elasticity, a cautious approach to increasing prices is necessary. Customer feedback is crucial in determining their maximum willingness to pay, which suggests we should continue collecting data and customer perceptions before making further moves. Keeping prices aligned with competitors is also important, as seen with various competitor pricing experiments.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue selling at $2.05 for an additional two weeks to monitor customer retention and sales volume while collecting feedback on perceived value.
2. Conduct a survey to gather specific customer feedback on their willingness to pay, focusing on values up to $2.15.
3. If customer feedback suggests potential for price increase, test $2.10 in the following month, observing its impact on sales and profit.
4. If the increase to $2.10 is well-received, consider testing $2.15 with close monitoring of its impact on volume and profitability.
5. Regularly reassess competitor prices to maintain a competitive edge and optimize profit margins.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Selling at $2.05 balances customer demand and profit, providing consistent sales volume.
2. Customers show moderate sensitivity to price increases, with noticeable declines in quantity sold when prices exceed $2.10.
3. Direct customer feedback regarding willingness to pay is essential for assessing potential price increases.
4. Long-term stability at a price point should be tested before making drastic adjustments to ensure sustained profit levels.
5. Continuous alignment with competitor strategies is necessary to maintain a competitive advantage while maximizing profitability.
6. Price elasticity suggests caution is necessary with any price increases; slight adjustments should be tested carefully while monitoring customer response.
