Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for the current cycle (at least one month) to ensure stable sales and profit.
2. After the current cycle, test a price increase to $2.05 for the subsequent month while closely monitoring sales and profit metrics.
3. Consider testing $2.10 if $2.05 proves successful, but limit testing periods to one month and analyze customer responses.
4. Continue evaluating customer feedback regarding price sensitivity and perceptions.
5. Regularly analyze competitors' pricing to ensure competitive positioning in the market.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.00 price point maximizes steady sales and profit without significant loss.
2. Incremental price hikes to $2.05 indicate a potential for increased revenue while maintaining relative sales thresholds.
3. Significant drops in sales at higher price points (like $2.25 and $2.30) suggest a price sensitivity among customers that warrants caution.
4. The company must remain responsive to customer feedback to refine pricing strategies continually.
5. Regular monitoring of competitors' prices remains critical for maintaining competitive positioning and optimizing our pricing strategy in response to market changes.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Analyzing the provided market data and previous pricing strategies, the price of $2.00 has consistently yielded steady sales and profit, which suggests it is a safe baseline. The incremental price hike to $2.05 showed more promising signs for increased revenue, albeit with a slight reduction in quantity sold. Price increases beyond this range, such as to $2.10 or $2.25, resulted in significant drops in sales, highlighting price sensitivity. Currently, it seems best to aim for a stable price that maximizes profit without drastically reducing sales volume. I recommend maintaining the price at $2.05 for the current cycle, assessing if it can sustain volume or if it needs to revert to $2.00.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.05 for the current cycle (at least one month) to gauge sales and profit stability.
2. Analyze sales performance at $2.05 and customer feedback regarding price sensitivity.
3. If sales remain stable at $2.05, consider testing an increase to $2.10 in the subsequent pricing cycle but keep the testing period to one month.
4. Continue to monitor competitor pricing and respond accordingly to any shifts in the market.
5. Gather customer feedback to refine pricing strategies and understand perceptions of value.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.00 price point has consistently maximized steady sales and profit.
2. The price increment to $2.05 appears viable as it still maintains reasonable sales volume with moderate profit increases.
3. Higher price points like $2.10 and $2.25 resulted in notable drops in volume sold, highlighting customer price sensitivity.
4. Customer feedback remains essential for ongoing adjustments to pricing strategies.
5. Active monitoring of competitor pricing is crucial for remaining competitive and attracting customers.

My chosen price:
2.05
