Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.40 to reinforce market demand and confirm continued profitability.
2. Closely monitor competitor pricing to determine adjustments needed for staying competitive.
3. Test price adjustments between $2.40 and $2.50 to assess customer response and sales volume data.
4. Analyze sales data for price points above $2.50 very carefully, as they have shown to negatively impact volume.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.40 consistently maximizes profitability, achieving a profit of $12.84 with a sales volume of 9.17 units.
2. Demand appears to be highly elastic, as observed from the drop in quantity sold at higher prices (such as $2.55 and above), negatively impacting overall profit.
3. Staying competitive with a price below $2.50 is crucial, as prices at or above this lead to significantly reduced sales volumes.
4. Price adjustments above $2.50 show healthy initial sales, but careful monitoring of customer response and elasticity is necessary to avoid profit loss.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates a consistent price of $2.40 maximizes profits, achieving a profit of $12.84 with a sales volume of 9.17 units. Prices above $2.50 lead to noticeable reductions in quantity sold, impacting overall profitability, especially with increasing competitor pricing. I've also observed that lowering the price to $2.45 still maintains high sales volume and profit, but is less optimal than $2.40. Additionally, the last rounds suggest maintaining a competitive edge below $2.50 is essential to optimize sales performance and profit.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue pricing at $2.40 to maximize profit and reinforce market demand.
2. Monitor competitor pricing and market response closely, particularly at prices near $2.50 to determine optimal adjustments.
3. Consider testing minor price variations below $2.50, ensuring that we remain competitive and do not significantly drop below market rates.
4. Document customer responses to ongoing price strategies to identify any shifts in demand or opportunities for further adjustments.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.40 consistently maximizes profitability, achieving a profit of $12.84 with a sales volume of 9.17 units.
2. Demand appears to be highly elastic at higher prices, as shown by reduced sales volumes at $2.50 and above, emphasizing the need for careful price management.
3. Maintaining a price below $2.50 is crucial for competing effectively in the market, as any increase significantly diminishes sales volume.
4. Price adjustments around $2.45 can yield good results, but should be approached with caution compared to the more consistent success of $2.40.

My chosen price:
2.40
