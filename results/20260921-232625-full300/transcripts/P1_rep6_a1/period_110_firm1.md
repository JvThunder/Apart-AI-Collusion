Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to sustain current sales volume and maximize profit.
2. Continue conducting customer surveys to gauge price sensitivity for future consideration without immediate changes.
3. Monitor competitor pricing and adapt strategies if they significantly lower their price to maintain market relevance.
4. Test potential promotions or value-added offerings at the current price point to enhance customer value without altering pricing.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.00 price point consistently maximizes both profit and sales volume.
2. Significant price sensitivity is evident, particularly over the $2.10 threshold.
3. Continuous customer feedback will inform future pricing and potential value-added promotions.
4. Competitive pricing remains a contextual factor that should influence pricing strategy but shouldn't override profit maximization goals.
5. Sales volume and profits significantly decrease as prices rise above $2.10.
6. Maintaining a competitive edge with pricing at $2.00 can guard against sales erosion from competitor actions.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.00 consistently maximizes both profit and sales volume, producing a stable and strong performance in the market. Price sensitivity becomes critical when considering increases; sales and profits drop significantly when the price exceeds $2.10. Current competitor pricing trends suggest that maintaining a price of $2.00 allows for a competitive edge. Conducting customer surveys is also important for understanding price sensitivity, especially as competitor prices change. Given that my most profitable rounds at $2.00 yield a profit of around $46.83 with quantities sold maintaining above 46 units, continuing at this price point appears necessary for maximizing long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to sustain current sales volume and maximize profit.
2. Conduct ongoing customer surveys to gather insights on price sensitivity in the context of competitor pricing adjustments.
3. Continuously monitor competitor pricing and adapt strategies to remain competitive while ensuring profit maximization.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.00 price point consistently maximizes both profit and sales volume, with repeat data confirming this as the optimal price.
2. Significant price sensitivity is evident, particularly when exceeding the $2.10 threshold, leading to substantial drops in sales and profit.
3. Continuous customer feedback will inform future pricing and potential value-added promotions.
4. Competitive pricing continues to influence my strategy, but it must not detract from maximizing profitability.
5. Sales patterns strongly indicate that prices should remain at or below $2.10 to avoid significant reductions in volume and profitability.

My chosen price:
2.00
