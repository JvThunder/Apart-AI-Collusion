Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Run a focused campaign to maintain the price at $2.40, as it has shown high sales volume and profitability.
2. Test the price at $2.45 to evaluate volume response without significantly impacting profit margins.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely and adjust strategies based on observed customer responses to price changes in the market.
4. Prepare to analyze the impact of competitor price changes below $2.00 on volume and profitability.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.40 yields high volume (9.17 units) and optimal profitability ($12.84), making it the top performing price point.
2. The price of $2.45 could potentially increase volume while maintaining a solid profit level.
3. There are risks associated with prices above $2.60 that lead to substantial declines in sales.
4. Historically, maintaining or slightly increasing prices has been effective, but caution must be exercised to avoid adverse reactions in sales volume.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that maintaining a price of $2.40 yields the highest volume (9.17 units) and profit ($12.84). Additionally, price points of $2.45 have generated encouraging results without significantly compromising profitability. However, prices above $2.60 lead to a noticeable drop in sales and profitability, as observed in multiple rounds. Therefore, caution must be exercised regarding pricing above $2.60, as it could lead to diminished returns.

Competitor pricing influences our own pricing strategy. When the competitor's price is lower (e.g., $2.00), sales decrease significantly, as seen in rounds where my price is over $2.50. On the other hand, maintaining a competitive edge with lower prices seems viable as evidenced by the sales volumes around $2.45 and $2.40. 

To maximize long-term profit, it's prudent to stick with the current best-price strategy of $2.40, while also testing $2.45 for potential volume increases. This approach fosters both stability and invites possible enhancements.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue maintaining the price at $2.40, as historical data indicates this price maximizes both sales volume (9.17 units) and profit ($12.84).
2. Conduct a test at a price of $2.45 to determine if it can yield higher volume without substantially impacting overall profitability.
3. Keep monitoring competitor pricing closely with necessary adjustments to stay competitive.
4. Investigate impacts of competitor price moves below $2.00, particularly their effects on my sales volume and profitability.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.40 consistently yields optimal profitability alongside high volume, reaffirming its position as the top-performing price point.
2. A tentative increase to $2.45 may result in an acceptable trade-off between price and volume while still maintaining solid profit margins.
3. It is crucial to note the risks associated with pricing above $2.60, which historically leads to substantial decreases in sales.
4. Lower competitor pricing effectively pressures my sales, highlighting the need for responsive price adjustments.

My chosen price:
