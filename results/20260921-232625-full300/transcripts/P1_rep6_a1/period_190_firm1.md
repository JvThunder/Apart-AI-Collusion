Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Increase the price to $2.20 for the next cycle and closely monitor sales volume and customer feedback.
2. If customer acceptance at $2.20 is favorable, consider testing a price up to $2.30 while carefully observing the impact on sales volume.
3. If sales decline significantly at any point, be prepared to revert to $2.10 as a fallback option.
4. Analyze customer feedback after each price adjustment to gauge acceptance and price sensitivity.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price point of $2.00 generates stable sales and profits but restricts earnings potential compared to competitors.
2. Customer sensitivity notably increases above a price of $2.10, which means caution is necessary when raising prices.
3. Testing $2.20 will provide insights into customer willingness to pay without significant drops in volume.
4. Observed sales drop significantly at higher price points, suggesting a careful approach is necessary for future pricing adjustments.
5. Competitors maintain price points between $2.35 and $2.45, indicating potential for price increases while requiring careful monitoring of customer responses.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Given the competitors' price points between $2.35 and $2.45, along with previous customer sensitivity observed above $2.10, it seems viable to explore increasing the price to $2.20. The recent testing has indicated that at $2.20, customer response still allows for a reasonable sales volume, albeit lower than previous rounds at $2.00. However, the goal is to refine pricing to find the sweet spot for long-term profitability. Monitoring sales and customer feedback at this price point is crucial. The data also suggests that selling at higher price points may still yield acceptable quantity sold, as evidenced by sales at $2.25 and impacts on volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $2.20 for the next cycle and closely monitor sales volume and customer feedback.
2. If customer acceptance at $2.20 is favorable, explore the potential to increase the price to $2.25 while continuing to observe sales and customer responses.
3. Maintain a fallback option to revert to $2.10 if any significant sales drop is detected.
4. Analyze customer feedback and sales data after each price adjustment to better understand price sensitivity and customer preferences.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.00 generates stable sales and profits but limits earning potential compared to competitors.
2. Customer sensitivity notably increases above a price of $2.10, necessitating careful monitoring when increasing prices.
3. Testing $2.20 has provided insights indicating a moderate decrease in sales volume, but with acceptable profit potential.
4. Selling at $2.25 generated lower volume but also greater margins in some cases, suggesting potential for profit maximization with strategic price adjustments.
5. Competitors maintain price points between $2.35 and $2.45, indicating more room for price adjustments while needing to closely monitor customer responses.

My chosen price:
2.20
