Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
I see that maintaining the price at $2.40 has consistently yielded solid profits and high volume. The market data shows that when the pricing was below $2.50, particularly at $2.40, the quantity sold was compelling, and profits were optimal (e.g., Round 77, 80-109). There is a risk from competitors pricing around $2.00; feedback suggests that keeping our price competitive while high enough to maintain profit margins is critical. Testing slight price adjustments above $2.40 (like $2.45) while observing their impact is essential given competitor reactions. However, significant drops in sales volume at prices of $2.60 and $2.55 indicate sensitivity. Therefore, maintaining $2.40 for one more round while monitoring customer feedback and competitor pricing is the best strategy to maximize long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.40 for the next round to maximize profitability.
2. Gather customer feedback regarding the perceived value of the product at the $2.40 price point.
3. Monitor competitor pricing consistently, particularly against prices below $2.00.
4. Explore slight price changes to $2.45 in subsequent rounds based on feedback and market response.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.40 has consistently yielded optimal profitability alongside high volume, indicating it as the optimal price point.
2. Competitor prices significantly impact sales volume; thus, price sensitivity is crucial for our strategy.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing, especially near the $2.00 mark, is essential for maintaining our market position.
4. Customer feedback will provide valuable insights into price sensitivity and may assist in refining pricing strategies in future rounds.
