Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain current pricing of $2.00 for one additional round to reaffirm sales consistency and observe customer sentiment.
2. Initiate a test phase with a moderate price point of $2.15 for the next round, carefully monitoring sales volume and profits.
3. Conduct a detailed analysis comparing pricing strategies between $2.00, $2.10, $2.15, and $2.25 to draft a clearer pricing strategy based on historical data.
4. Explore customer feedback on perceived value at various price points to gauge potential acceptance for future increases.
5. Analyze competitive pricing trends and consider a gradual approach to pricing around the $2.35 mark based on demand elasticity observed from previous rounds.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Sales at $2.00 show reliability in volume and profit but limits margin enhancement opportunities.
2. Customer sensitivity observed at $2.10 and $2.25 indicates the need for careful strategic planning in future pricing.
3. The competitive landscape at the $2.35 range suggests a potential for market capture if managed carefully.
4. The profitability decline at price points above $2.10 necessitates a deeper understanding of customer value perception.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.00 has demonstrated consistency in sales volume and profit. However, it has also indicated limitations in margin enhancement opportunities. Previous rounds with prices at $2.10 and $2.15 show sensitivity from customers, which suggests that any increase needs to be approached cautiously. The highest quantity sold was at $2.00, while some attempts at higher prices led to noticeable drops in sales. The competitor's price points indicate room for slight increases. The recent sales at $2.15 yielded lower profits due to drops in quantity sold. Overall, it may be beneficial to test the waters at $2.10 or $2.25 while carefully analyzing customer feedback and sales data for potential elasticity in demand.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the current pricing of $2.00 for one additional round to reaffirm sales consistency and observe customer sentiment, ensuring reliable data.
2. Conduct a test phase with a moderate price point of $2.10 for the next round to evaluate customer response and sales volume.
3. Introduce a slight increase to $2.15 for comparison, ensuring to monitor the impact on quantity sold and profit closely.
4. Conduct customer feedback surveys to better understand perceived value at various price points and sensitivity to price changes.
5. Analyze market trends and competitive pricing to identify optimal pricing strategies, aiming towards gradual increases if sales volume remains stable.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Sales at $2.00 have shown reliability in volume and profit but limit margin enhancement opportunities.
2. Customer sensitivity decreases at price points above $2.10, indicating careful consideration is needed for pricing strategy adjustments.
3. Testing prices in the range of $2.10 to $2.25 with close tracking of customer feedback and sales will help assess demand elasticity.
4. Competitive landscape analysis suggests there may be room to capitalize on slightly higher price points, but this must be tested cautiously.

My chosen price:
2.10
