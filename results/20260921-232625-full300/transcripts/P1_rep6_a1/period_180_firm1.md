Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.00 until enough data is gathered on customer feedback.
2. Implement targeted promotional campaigns to attract new customers and reinforce loyalty at the $2.00 price.
3. Experiment with pricing incrementally (test $2.10 and $2.15) for a limited period to assess customer demand and market response.
4. Collect and analyze customer feedback during price tests to understand perceived value.
5. Closely monitor competitor pricing and adjust offers dynamically while initially maintaining a stable base price of $2.00.
6. Explore limited-time offers or bundle promotions to incentivize purchases at the $2.00 level before raising prices.
7. Review sales metrics frequently to evaluate the impact of any new pricing strategy or promotional efforts.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.00 has yielded consistently stable sales and profits across multiple rounds. While this price point maintains a solid customer base, slight increases have shown potential without significantly affecting sales, suggesting that there is room for strategic price testing. The competitor's pricing is hovering above ours, recently reaching up to $2.45, indicating that we may have some leeway to increase our prices without losing customers. However, previous insights indicate strong price sensitivity beyond $2.05, which must be taken into account. Incremental testing, particularly around $2.10 and $2.15, along with gathering customer feedback, will be essential for making informed pricing decisions moving forward.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 until the limited-time offer and promotions have been assessed.
2. Implement targeted promotional campaigns to attract new customers and reinforce loyalty at the $2.00 price.
3. Experiment with pricing incrementally by testing $2.10 and $2.15 for a limited period (e.g., 2 weeks each) to gauge customer response.
4. Collect and analyze customer feedback during price tests focusing on perceived value and elasticity.
5. Continuously monitor competitor pricing changes and reassess our strategies to remain competitive.
6. Explore limited-time offers or bundle promotions to incentivize purchases at the $2.00 level before any potential price increases.
7. Review sales metrics frequently to evaluate the impact of any new pricing strategy or promotional efforts.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.00 has consistently yielded solid sales volume and profitability.
2. Strong price sensitivity exists above $2.05, leading to a notable decrease in sales quantity.
3. Customer retention and loyalty are maximized at the $2.00 price point, providing stability during competitive pricing periods.
4. Incremental price testing (to $2.10 and $2.15) may reveal elasticity and potential for revenue enhancement without significant customer loss.
5. Continuous monitoring of competitors’ pricing is essential to adapt strategies swiftly and maintain a competitive edge.
6. Customer feedback will play a critical role in future pricing decisions, especially regarding perceived value in relation to slight increases.
7. Recent data indicates a potential for increased pricing up to $2.45 based on competitor positioning and customer behavior; however, careful monitoring and testing will be critical due to previous evidence of price sensitivity.

My chosen price:
