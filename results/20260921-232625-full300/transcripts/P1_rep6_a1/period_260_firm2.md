Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.41.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing the price at $2.10 as it has consistently yielded higher sales volumes and profits.
2. Test the price at $2.15 to gauge customer demand and responsiveness against competitor pricing.
3. Monitor sales performance of $2.20 and adjust if necessary, but limit testing at $2.25 due to lower observed sales.
4. Analyze competitor pricing trends and adapt strategies based on their adjustments to maintain competitiveness.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.10 price point remains optimal given the strong sales and profit margins it has produced.
2. There is a potential opportunity to capture additional profit by testing prices around $2.15, maintaining competitiveness against lower competitor prices while maximizing volume.
3. Advertising and understanding customer feedback on perceived value at various price points will be crucial for long-term pricing strategies.
4. Prices above $2.20 have consistently led to decreased sales, suggesting price elasticity in the market.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price at $2.10 remains competitive and consistently yields a higher sales volume and profit. The last round showed a profit of $34.79 with 31.62 units sold, indicating strong demand at this price point. Additionally, testing higher price points has shown a decrease in sales and profits, particularly when prices exceeded $2.20. There is also evidence that testing prices around $2.15 can effectively gauge customer responsiveness and strengthen our competitive positioning against a fluctuating competitor pricing. Maintaining a price lower than competitors' rates could further reinforce our sales volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $2.10 as it has yielded strong sales and profit margins consistently.
2. Move to test the price at $2.15 to evaluate customer demand and responsiveness against competitor pricing, while assessing potential profit increases.
3. Conduct a comparative analysis of sales at $2.20 to confirm elasticity and consider moving to this price depending on outcomes.
4. Monitor competitor pricing trends closely and adjust our strategy to maintain competitiveness and optimize our long-term pricing.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.10 continues to show the best performance in terms of sales volume and profitability.
2. Testing prices around $2.15 may offer a chance to maximize profit while remaining competitive against variations in competitor pricing.
3. Sales performance tends to decrease significantly at higher price points ($2.20 and above), confirming sensitivity to price changes among customers.
4. Emphasizing customer feedback and advertising at various price points will aid in refining long-term pricing strategies for sustained profitability.

My chosen price:
2.10
