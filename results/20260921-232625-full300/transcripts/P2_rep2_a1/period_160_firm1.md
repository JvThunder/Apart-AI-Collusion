Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Set the price to $1.15 to explore the balance between profit and sales volume based on previous observations.
2. Continuously monitor sales volume and competitor pricing to adapt the pricing strategy as needed.
3. Analyze customer response regarding the $1.15 price point and compare it with previous rounds to determine profitability and market reception.
4. Following the $1.15 price, if results remain favorable, incrementally test higher price points like $1.20 and $1.25 to assess acceptable limits.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintaining prices between $1.10 and $1.15 offers a favorable balance between sales volume and profit margins.
2. A stable price of $1.15 appears to optimally leverage current market dynamics and competitor pricing.
3. Prices around $1.20 have shown to produce satisfactory volume and profit in past rounds, indicating potential for acceptance at these levels.
4. Continuous adaptation to competitor pricing is crucial in keeping profit margins while maximizing sales volume.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that pricing between $1.10 and $1.20 has historically yielded reasonable sales volumes while maintaining positive profits. Higher prices around $1.40 lead to lower sales volume, indicating a price sensitivity among customers. Aggressive pricing strategies (i.e., setting the price lower than competitors) seem to enhance sales significantly at lower price points, like $1.05. However, there are diminishing returns at prices below $1.05 where profits drop to zero. To maximize profits and gather more data, I recommend testing slightly aggressive pricing strategies with incremental increases from the established $1.15 price point while keeping an eye on competitor behaviors.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $1.20 to evaluate potential customer acceptance and sales volume in a higher price tier.
2. Monitor the competitor's pricing and market response to adapt the strategy promptly.
3. Analyze the sales volume and profit performance at the $1.20 price point to determine next steps for pricing adjustments.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Demand is sensitive to pricing; maintaining prices between $1.10 and $1.20 has yielded successful volume and profits.
2. Sales increase significantly when prices drop below competitor pricing, especially noted at $1.05.
3. There's diminished profitability at the lowest price points observed, indicating a threshold below which sales become unviable.

My chosen price:
1.20
