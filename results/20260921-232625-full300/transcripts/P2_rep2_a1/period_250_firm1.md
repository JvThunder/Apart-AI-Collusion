Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test pricing at $1.10 for a round to assess the balance between volume and profit, especially against competitors' prices.
2. Maintain $1.15 as a baseline price.
3. Continue conducting limited-time promotions at $1.20, monitoring performance against competitors to evaluate customer willingness to pay.
4. Analyze data for sales volume and profit at $1.25 and potentially drop to $1.20 if competition requires it.
5. Test $1.30 if competition allows for a specified limited time, to examine if high pricing yields better profit margins.
6. Maintain vigilance on competitor pricing and adjust strategies according to observed market trends.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. $1.15 remains a strong baseline for balancing profit and volume.
2. Customer tolerance for prices around $1.20 is confirmed through promotions with improved profits.
3. Lower prices like $1.10 may yield increased volume but reduced profitability, necessitating a careful strategic pricing evaluation.
4. Market dynamics show significant influence from competitor pricing necessitating active adjustments in our pricing strategy.
5. Higher pricing ($1.25) has potential but requires careful monitoring of sales volume to avoid significant drops in quantity sold.
6. Testing higher prices ($1.30) may reveal further elasticity in demand, providing insights into customer willingness to pay.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
From the market data, there appears to be a direct correlation between the price points and the quantity sold. Lowering the price generally results in higher sales volume but often sacrifices profit margins (as seen with the prices of $1.05 and $1.10). Conversely, higher prices like $1.25 yield better profit per unit but can significantly reduce quantity sold. The recent test rounds demonstrate that $1.20 has consistently performed well, balancing quantity sold and profit earned, especially against competitors priced lower or at parity. The ideal strategy may involve pivoting towards a more dynamic pricing approach around $1.20, with occasional tests at $1.25 to understand the upper limit of customer willingness to pay. Additionally, when competitors are at $1.10 or lower, it may be in the interest to maintain a competitive edge.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test $1.20 as a continual pricing point to maximize profit based on past performance metrics.
2. Conduct a limited-time promotion at $1.25 for one round to assess customer response and demand elasticity.
3. Monitor competitor pricing actively and be prepared to adjust prices in response to any significant shifts.
4. If competitive pressures arise, consider reverting to $1.15 with a focus on maintaining consistent volume.
5. Explore the viability of temporary price drops to $1.10 to maximize volume when competitors reduce their prices.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $1.20 price point continues to yield favorable balance between quantity sold and profit margins, representing a strong price strategy.
2. Higher pricing at $1.25 is worth testing in a limited capacity to gauge elasticity and maximize profit in stronger markets.
3. Competitive influences necessitate proactive pricing adjustments to stay relevant and appealing to customers.
4. Historical data reaffirms that lower prices encourage volume but dilute profit, highlighting the importance of choosing the right balance.

My chosen price:
1.20
