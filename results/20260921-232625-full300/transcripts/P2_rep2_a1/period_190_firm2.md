Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue monitoring sales at $1.10, but also gather preliminary data on $1.05. 
2. Implement strategies for aggressive pricing at $1.05 next, while analyzing competitor responses closely.
3. After implementing $1.05, reassess sales volume and profit for possible further adjustments.
4. Consider testing price points between $1.00 and $1.10 in the future to evaluate elasticity and consumer response.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Continuing to explore lower price points helps gauge demand elasticity and competitor reactions, crucial for long-term strategy.
- Historical data indicates that significant sales volumes at lower prices might not always counterbalance reduced profit margins.
- The tendency for sales volume to drop significantly above $1.10 reinforces the importance of remaining competitive with pricing.
- Monitoring and quickly adapting to competitive pricing trends have proven key for maximizing margins while maintaining sales flow.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy has not been effective in maximizing profits. At $1.25, the sales consistently show a quantity sold of approximately 34 units, resulting in moderate profits. The shift to $1.20 shows a slight increase in volume but a reduction in profit margin. The most notable increase in sales volume occurred at $1.10 when the competitor was priced at $1.05, leading to a spike in sales (63.45 units) but still relatively lower profits due to the aggressive pricing of the competitor. Testing $1.05, despite its lower profit per unit, also resulted in significant volume but not enough to offset costs effectively. A consistent trend shows that lower prices attract more significant sales volume, and testing further reductions around $1.05 may be worthwhile. To maximize long-term profit, I will introduce testing of an intriguing pricing point of $1.00, as it has consistently drawn significant volume. This data will help gauge demand elasticity as well.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue monitoring sales at $1.10 while analyzing responses at $1.05.
2. Test price point of $1.00 to evaluate demand elasticity and competitor reactions.
3. Gather data at $1.00 and reassess long-term profitability and sales volume.
4. Continue to explore lower price points to collect insights on consumer demand behavior.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Monitoring and experimenting with lower price points significantly affects sales volume and can yield valuable feedback on consumer demand elasticity.
- The current highest selling price of $1.10 is not generating optimal profits given the competitive pricing landscape.
- Lower prices tend to entice larger sales volumes, but the accompanying profit margins need to be carefully weighed against costs.
- Consistent adjustments to price strategy will be crucial for staying competitive and maximizing overall profit potential.

My chosen price:
1.00
