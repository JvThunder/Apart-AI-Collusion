Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing aggressive low price points at $1.10 and $1.15 to confirm sales volume trends.
2. Conduct tests at $1.20 to evaluate volume and profitability around this equilibrium price point.
3. Implement a marketing campaign highlighting value at lower price points to enhance perceived value.
4. Analyze competitor pricing dynamics more intensively to keep our pricing competitive and attractive.
5. Gather comprehensive customer feedback regarding price sensitivity and perceived value after price adjustments.
6. Review all previous rounds to assess the cumulative impact of pricing strategies on overall profitability.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Strong historical demand at lower price points indicates a need for continued competitive pricing.
2. Prices below $1.30 consistently result in higher sales volumes, emphasizing volume-driven strategies.
3. Customer sensitivity data suggests caution when raising prices above $1.20, as this may impact demand.
4. Enhanced marketing strategies at lower price points can boost perceived value and stabilize sales.
5. Continuous competitor price monitoring is crucial to maintaining an attractive pricing strategy in a competitive market.
6. Optimal strategy should balance unit profit and sales volume for sustained long-term profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

My observations and thoughts:
The data shows a clear correlation between lower prices and increased quantities sold. The lowest prices tested ($1.10, $1.15) resulted in the highest sales volumes, although profits per unit were lower. Meanwhile, prices around $1.20 have historically resulted in considerable sales (e.g., 74.52 units sold) with lower profit margins per unit. It appears that $1.10 and $1.15 are very attractive price points, leading to potential sales maximization but lower profits. Conversely, when prices go above $1.20, both quantities sold and profit seem to decrease. 

Overall, an aggressive pricing strategy primarily focusing on capturing volume at $1.10 and possibly incorporating marketing might optimize long-term profitability. There’s also a clear indication that we need to continue competitive monitoring against our competitors’ prices, suggesting that simply matching or slightly underpricing (especially at $1.20) could sustain sales.
