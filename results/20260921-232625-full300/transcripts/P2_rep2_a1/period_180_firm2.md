Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Set the price to $1.10 for the next four cycles to test its effect on sales volume and profit.
2. Continue monitoring competitor pricing and adjust dynamically to maintain our competitive edge.
3. Collect customer feedback regarding price sensitivity and perceived value.
4. Analyze the performance of $1.10 compared to previous prices of $1.15 and $1.25 to find the optimal long-term profit price point.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Sales volume tends to favor lower prices but must be balanced against profitability per unit.
- Testing pricing around $1.10 has shown favorable acceptance, indicating it may be within the optimal price point range.
- A slight increase to $1.15 does not yield substantial convertible profit relative to $1.10, while $1.25 corresponds with a drop in sales volume.
- Competitive pricing dynamics demonstrate that setting lower prices than competitors can significantly drive sales, suggesting ongoing price adjustments are crucial for maximizing profits.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data shows that lower prices tend to lead to higher sales volumes, often maximizing profit despite lower unit margins. The price points of $1.10 and $1.15 both demonstrate reasonable acceptance, with $1.10 generating the highest quantity sold in the most recent rounds. By continuing to test the lower price of $1.05 against $1.10, we can further assess the price elasticity of demand for our product and identify the optimal price point.

Furthermore, maintaining a competitive edge with dynamic pricing is crucial; consistently undercutting competitors when they lower their prices can significantly enhance sales volume. However, the risk of profits being too low (near the production cost) when setting prices at $1.00 must be weighed.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $1.05 for the next four cycles to evaluate its impact on sales volume and profit against the currently tested price of $1.10.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely, adjusting our price dynamically to stay below or match their rates to ensure competitive viability.
3. Continue collecting customer feedback regarding price elasticity and perceived value.
4. Conduct a detailed analysis comparing the outcomes of pricing at $1.05, $1.10, and $1.15 to determine more definitive optimal pricing strategies for long-term profit maximization.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Sales volume is significantly influenced by price setting; lower prices are more accepted, especially when competing with lower-priced alternatives.
- Testing at $1.05 can provide insight into price elasticity and perceived value, helping to identify whether this price can outperform higher price points in volume and profitability.
- Consistently underpricing competitors has historically led to higher sales, reinforcing the effectiveness of aggressive pricing strategies in enhancing market share and long-term profitability.

My chosen price:
1.05
