Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.80.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue testing the $1.15 price point against competitors, given its stable sales volume and profit earnings.
2. Evaluate the influence of a $1.05 price on overall sales and its implications for longer-term pricing strategy. 
3. Monitor competitor responses to our changes and analyze any price undercutting opportunities.
4. Test an aggressive pricing strategy with a $1.00 price for a limited time to observe elasticity and customer response and compare it to higher price points.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Testing lower price points can attract a larger customer base, but may not necessarily maximize profit margins.
2. Sales volume at $1.15 and $1.20 indicates a sustained interest in value without compromising too much on profit.
3. Continual observation of competitors' reactions is essential in adapting our pricing strategy effectively.
4. A pricing strategy that balances initial lower prices with a gradual return to a higher price can test customer loyalty and brand perception dynamics.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Upon reviewing the market data, it seems that several price points have yielded stable profits while allowing for variations in sales volume in response to competitors' prices. The recent testing of $1.15 shows a consistent volume of around 44-49 units sold, but when undercutting to $1.05, the sales volume increases significantly, even though the profit margin is lower. The highest profit of $12.20 was achieved at the $1.25 price point but with decreased volume. Testing the lower price points should continue as they help gauge price elasticity and customer behavior. Observing competitors’ pricing strategies is crucial to identify the optimal price range.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the $1.15 price point against competitors, given its stable sales volume and profit earnings.
2. Assess the impact of the recently tested $1.05 price on total profit and customer engagement.
3. Monitor competitor responses, especially any pricing changes, to analyze potential undercutting opportunities.
4. Initiate limited-time testing of aggressive pricing at $1.00 to study customer response patterns while comparing it to results from higher price points.
5. Prepare to analyze the performance of $1.20 pricing with the intent to capture the balance between volume and profit.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Lower price points like $1.05 attract significantly higher sales volumes but potentially lessen per-unit profit margins.
2. The price stability at $1.15 fosters consistent demand without compromising much on margins.
3. Competitors' pricing actions can drastically impact sales; continuous monitoring is essential for effective pricing strategy adjustment.
4. Understanding customer loyalty and perceived value is critical when fluctuating prices, indicating the potential effectiveness of maintaining a gradual price increase following initial low pricing tests.
