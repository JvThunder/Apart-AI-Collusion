Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.19.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue monitoring performance at $1.49 and evaluate its long-term profitability.
2. Introduce additional price points of $1.20 and $1.25 to analyze sales volume and overall profit impacts.
3. Further explore consumer responsiveness to aggressive pricing strategies below $1.35 for maximizing sales and market share.
4. Keep conducting ongoing analysis of competitor pricing to dynamically adjust our pricing strategy based on market conditions.
5. Consider implementing promotional pricing strategies or discounts for limited periods to stimulate demand further.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data suggests strong consumer responsiveness to lower pricing, particularly around the $1.35 mark and below. Price points like $1.20 and $1.25 have shown increased sales volume, but significantly lower prices, such as $1.19 and $1.18, have maximized volume even further while maintaining relatively decent profits. Continuing to assess the competitive landscape is crucial, especially with competitors pricing around the low $1.40s. It may be beneficial to implement further testing of aggressive pricing strategies and examine consumer reactions, especially given the good performance at price points like $1.35 and $1.40.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue monitoring performance at $1.49 while analyzing long-term profitability.
2. Implement low pricing strategies at $1.18 and $1.19 to gauge potential demand and sales volume increase.
3. Explore price drops to $1.15 for limited periods to assess impacts on market share and profit.
4. Maintain ongoing analysis of competitor pricing to adapt strategy based on market conditions.
5. Analyze data on customer behavior in response to promotional pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Demand elasticity has been confirmed through increased sales volume at lower prices, particularly below $1.35.
2. The impact of competitor pricing is significant, underscoring the need for ongoing monitoring to remain competitive.
3. Testing aggressive pricing could unearth optimal profit margins, ensuring high sales volume without sacrificing profitability.
4. The performance variations in different price segments indicate potential for greater profit if lower pricing strategies are effectively utilized.
5. Recent tests at $1.18 and $1.19 have shown promising sales volume, indicating continued exploration of lower pricing can yield positive results.

My chosen price:
