Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.19.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Conduct tests at $1.35 and $1.25 to analyze the trade-off between sales volume and profit margins more deeply.
2. Test a potential aggressive price of $1.19 to uncover any latent demand while monitoring competitor pricing closely.
3. Reassess the sales data for $1.49 and lower prices to gauge effects on buyer behavior and profit trends.
4. Test additional prices of $1.30 and $1.40 to understand their impact on sales volumes and profits.
5. Actively track competitor performance and adjust pricing strategies dynamically for responsiveness to market changes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price point of $1.49 continues to yield reliable sales and profitability metrics, confirming its status as a strong pillar for pricing strategy.
2. Sales volumes at prices like $1.35 indicate a higher sensitivity to price, suggesting a strategic opportunity for lower pricing.
3. Monitoring competitor prices remains critical; adjustments may be required based on their reactions to changes in our pricing.
4. Aggressive testing of prices below $1.30 may reveal new consumer segments but must be carefully evaluated against profit margins.
5. Testing $1.30 and $1.40 alongside existing prices may provide insights into volume versus profit trade-offs.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The previous market data indicates that pricing strategies within the range of $1.35 to $1.49 yield relatively stable sales volumes and profits. The price of $1.49 remains a consistent performer, bringing in significant sales numbers while competitors price around this level. Testing lower prices such as $1.25 or $1.19 could reveal potential demand elasticity, though there is a risk of decreased profit margins. Observing competitor reactions and aligning pricing strategies can provide a competitive edge, especially when priced lower than competitors while still maintaining an acceptable margin above production costs.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing at $1.19 and $1.25 to evaluate how lowering prices affects sales volume and profit margins before making a final decision.
2. Explore higher volume sales using price points between $1.30 and $1.40 to balance between volume and profit margins effectively.
3. Continue assessing $1.49 as a reference price point due to its consistent performance.
4. Examine competitor pricing trends closely, making adjustments in real-time, particularly if they lower their prices.
5. Conduct aggressive volume testing with the $1.35 price point to analyze consumer behavior at mid-range pricing.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $1.49 consistently generates reliable sales and profitability metrics, confirming its value as a strong pricing pillar.
2. Aggressive testing of prices below $1.30, including $1.19, may open access to untapped consumer segments, but care must be taken to assess profit margins.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitors is essential; a drop in their prices should prompt a reassessment of our pricing strategy to remain competitive.
4. Prices at $1.35 have shown a higher sensitivity leading to increased sales; there could be an opportunity for growth with slight margin sacrifices.
5. Higher quantities sold at $1.75 when competitors price higher suggest that maintaining a strategic advantage in price can lead to substantial sales volumes.

My chosen price:
1.35
