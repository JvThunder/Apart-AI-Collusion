Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.19.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Further test the $1.24 price point to analyze its balance between volume sold and profit margins.
2. Conduct a short-term promotion at the current best-performing price point of $1.19 to assess potential spikes in volume.
3. Analyze market responses when competitors drop prices, particularly in the $1.19 to $1.29 range.
4. Continue tracking sales and profit outcomes for various price points across subsequent rounds to identify trends and make informed adjustments.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. Pricing at $1.19 moved significant volume but resulted in lower profit margins, suggesting it's best suited for short-term promotions rather than a standard pricing strategy.
2. The $1.24 price point maintains volume fairly well and offers improved profit margins compared to $1.19, warranting deeper exploration.
3. The $1.29 price has proven to be effective, producing a balance of volume and favorable profit margins, making it a strong contender for ongoing use.
4. Customer response remains sensitive to minor pricing shifts in the competitive landscape, especially in the lower pricing spectrum.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data reveals that pricing strategies vary significantly in terms of both volume sold and profits. The $1.19 price point is effective for high volume but offers lower profit margins, while the $1.29 price point demonstrates a better balance of volume and profit. The experiments with $1.24 indicate it is a middle ground that can potentially yield desirable outputs. From previous insights, lowering prices tends to increase volume sold, especially when positioned against competitors. Notably, there is a competitive sensitivity, particularly under the $1.30 mark, where small adjustments can lead to significant changes in sales. The recent trend suggests exploring both $1.24 and $1.29 more thoroughly in upcoming rounds while also considering the potential of short-term promotions.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the $1.24 price point extensively to measure its impact on volume sold and profit margins.
2. Conduct short-term promotions at the $1.29 price point to gauge volume spikes while checking market responses.
3. Monitor competitive prices closely and evaluate how adjusting to a $1.19 or lower strategy influences sales within the context of aggressive pricing.
4. Continue tracking sales and profit outcomes across different price points for more data-driven insights into customer behavior and price elasticity.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $1.19 price point drives significant volume; however, it is better suited for promotional activities due to low profit margins.
2. Pricing at $1.24 can offer a favorable compromise between volume and margins, suggesting potential as a stable price point.
3. The $1.29 price point has consistently shown to yield higher profits while maintaining reasonable sales volume.
4. Customer sensitivity to price shifts remains apparent, particularly in competitive pricing scenarios, warranting strategic monitoring.

My chosen price:
