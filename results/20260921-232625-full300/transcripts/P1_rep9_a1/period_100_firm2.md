Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price point at $2.05 to ensure stable sales volume and maximize profit.
2. Bi-weekly analysis of sales data to monitor customer response and competitor pricing.
3. Test a price increment to $2.10 for a defined period, observing sales volume and profit.
4. Gather customer feedback to assess price perception compared to the value offered.
5. Plan a gradual exploration of higher price points (up to $2.12) based on customer response and competition analysis.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.05 continues to be a strategic focal point, maximizing sales and profit potential.
2. At $2.10, a decline in quantity sold suggests that customers may be sensitive to price increases at this level.
3. Testing small price increments carefully is essential to avoid losing sales volume and overall profitability.
4. Customer feedback on pricing and perceived value is crucial for refining future pricing strategies.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy has shown that a price of $2.05 consistently results in strong sales volume and maintains profitability. However, raising the price to $2.10 tends to decrease quantity sold, indicating there may be price sensitivity among customers around this point. Additionally, attempts to slightly increase prices to $2.12 have not generated significantly better profits compared to the established price point. Given this sensitivity, I recommend continuing with $2.05 for the time being while performing ongoing market analysis. We should also explore customer feedback further to understand price perceptions better and gauge potential for higher pricing in the future.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price point at $2.05 to ensure stable sales volume and maximize profit.
2. Perform bi-weekly analysis of sales data to monitor customer response and competitor pricing.
3. Continue to gather customer feedback to assess price perception compared to the value offered.
4. Test the viability of raising the price to $2.10 and incrementally higher prices while closely monitoring sales volume and profit.
5. Explore pricing strategies that introduce promotions or discounts to measure their effect on sales while maintaining profitability.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.05 continues to be a strategic focal point, maximizing sales and profit potential.
2. A price of $2.10 results in reduced quantity sold, indicating price sensitivity among customers.
3. Customer feedback on pricing and perceived value is crucial for refining future pricing strategies.
4. Further research is needed to understand customers’ experiences and perceptions related to price points above $2.05.

My chosen price:
2.05
