Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the $2.05 price point for the upcoming round as it continues to yield a high sales volume and consistent profit.
2. Gradually test the $2.08 price point over the next two to three rounds to further assess its impact on sales volume and profit while monitoring customer response.
3. Evaluate the $2.10 price point once more to determine if any new data reveals a more favorable outcome than previously noted.
4. Remain vigilant regarding competitor pricing and adapt as necessary, especially if they adjust their prices downward.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.05 price consistently yields high sales volumes and maximum profit, establishing itself as a strong anchor point.
2. Price increments above $2.08 result in a significant decline in quantity sold, signaling strong price sensitivity among customers.
3. The $2.08 price point should be assessed further, as it allows for a marginal increase in income without sacrificing significant sales volume.
4. Continuous monitoring of the competitor's pricing strategy is essential to remain competitive; currently, it remains at $2.10.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The analysis of past pricing rounds indicates that the $2.05 price point is consistently leading to the highest sales volume and profits, primarily due to strong market acceptance. The recent tests with the $2.08 and $2.10 price points suggest there is notable price sensitivity; both of these higher prices resulted in a decrease in quantity sold. The competitor's price is currently at $2.10, which could create opportunities for strategic pricing adjustments. Testing the $2.08 price was beneficial for evaluating sales response, but consistent trends show that $2.05 maximizes profit effectively at large sales volumes. Maintaining vigilance against competitor moves, especially as they adjust prices, remains crucial.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the $2.05 price point for the upcoming round as it continues to yield high sales volume and maximum profit.
2. Continue monitoring the performance of the $2.08 price point but prioritize stability at $2.05 for overall profitability.
3. Evaluate market feedback on competitor pricing and consider incremental adjustments only if there's a significant shift in collector behavior.
4. Prepare to test a lower price point, such as $2.00, in the next rounds if sales volume begins to decline to counteract competitive pressure.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.05 price consistently yields high sales volumes and maximum profit, establishing itself as a strong anchor point.
2. Price increments above $2.08 lead to a significant decline in quantity sold, indicating strong price sensitivity among customers.
3. The $2.08 price point allows for a marginal income increase but should be assessed against potential sales volume drops.
4. Competitive pricing analysis emphasizes the need for adaptive strategies; as long as competitors maintain higher pricing, the current strategy of $2.05 remains advantageous.

My chosen price:
