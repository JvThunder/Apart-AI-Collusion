Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Set the price to $2.10 to leverage the higher sales volume and profit observed in Round 117.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely to remain competitive during this price point and adjust if necessary.
3. Gather customer feedback to assess the impact of the $2.10 price on sales perception and customer behavior.
4. After an evaluation period, consider testing $2.15 to assess its impact against $2.10.
5. Plan for potential time-limited promotions or discounts based on customer feedback and sales patterns at $2.10.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.10 significantly increased sales volume, indicating a strong price elasticity within the customer base.
2. Maintaining pricing near $2.10 while monitoring competitors can optimize profit margins and units sold.
3. Continuous collection of customer feedback is critical to providing insights on price sensitivity and potential adjustments.
4. A strategy of testing slightly higher prices, like $2.15, could help find an optimal balance between volume and profit.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the previous rounds, the price of $2.10 led to a significant increase in sales volume and profit, highlighting strong customer demand at this price point. In contrast, the more expensive price of $2.25 resulted in lower quantities sold and less profit despite some instances of consistent profitability. The competitor's price of $2.05 is a key factor influencing customer decisions, and monitoring this closely will be crucial. There were also positive results when testing a slight increase to $2.15, so it may be beneficial to continue testing variations between these price points to assess long-term elasticity.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $2.10 to capitalize on the demonstrated high sales volume and profit seen in recent rounds.
2. Continuously monitor competitors, particularly focusing on their pricing strategies and adjustments.
3. Collect customer feedback regarding the $2.10 price point and begin testing $2.15 to identify any shifts in sales and profit dynamics.
4. Assess market conditions for any potential seasonal promotions or adjustments based on customer feedback and sales performance at $2.10.
5. Maintain the focus on long-term profit maximization by ensuring that any pricing changes are well-informed and data-driven.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.10 price point has proven effective in maximizing sales volume and profit in recent rounds.
2. Customer sensitivity to competitor pricing remains high; thus, it is essential to keep close tabs on competitor pricing changes.
3. Positive returns from small price adjustments (e.g., testing $2.15) suggest room for exploration in pricing to optimize profit further.
4. Consistent customer feedback is vital for understanding price sensitivity and the overall perception of value at different price points.

My chosen price:
2.10
