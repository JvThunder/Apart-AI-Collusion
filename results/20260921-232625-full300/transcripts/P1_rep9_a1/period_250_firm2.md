Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue to set the price at $2.00 to maintain maximum sales volume and profit.
2. Keep a close watch on sales performance, customer feedback, and competitors' pricing to ensure the strategy remains optimal.
3. Plan for future analysis on potential adjustments beyond the $2.00 price point and strategize gradual increases if necessary.
4. Document any shifts in customer behavior or competitor pricing that could signal a need to re-evaluate our pricing approach.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing at $2.00 resulted in the highest sales volume (35.48 units) and profit ($35.48) consistently observed over numerous rounds.
2. Price sensitivity is evident, indicated by a decrease in sales and profit when the price is raised to $2.05 or higher.
3. Monitoring competitive pricing remains crucial as it significantly impacts our market position and sales performance.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The consistent data shows that setting the price at $2.00 yields the highest quantity sold (35.48 units) and maximum profit ($35.48). Recent analysis of rounds shows that raising the price to $2.05 results in decreased sales and profit, indicating high price sensitivity among customers. Although pricing at $2.05 allows for a slightly higher selling price, it does not lead to a proportionate increase in profit due to significantly reduced sales volume. Maintaining a competitive edge with a pricing strategy that reflects both sales volume and overall profitability will be crucial. The market data reaffirms that the optimal price remains at $2.00, and this strategy should continue to be prioritized.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to sustain the highest sales volume and profit observed in current market conditions.
2. Continuously monitor sales performance, customer feedback, and competitor pricing to ensure this strategy remains optimal.
3. Prepare to conduct further analysis on price elasticity and explore gradual price increases if sales behavior starts to shift or if significant competitor changes occur.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $2.00 has consistently resulted in the highest sales volume (35.48 units) and profit ($35.48).
2. Raising the price to $2.05 has led to decreased sales and profit, emphasizing the importance of price sensitivity.
3. It is vital to monitor competitive pricing, as it impacts market position and sales performance.
4. Current market data solidly supports a pricing strategy of $2.00, reflecting optimal profitability given observed patterns.

My chosen price:
