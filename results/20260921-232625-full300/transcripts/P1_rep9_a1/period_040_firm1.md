Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

My observations and thoughts:
The current data strongly supports the price point of $2.25, which has consistently yielded the highest profits over multiple rounds. Sales volume at this price also suggests strong customer acceptance. Strategies involving temporary reduction to $2.10 have only resulted in lower overall profits, despite potentially higher sales volumes. Bundling and promotional activities should be carefully evaluated to maintain profit margins while still attracting customer interest. Given that competitors often price around $2.10 to $2.25, our current pricing strategy is keeping us competitive and maximizing profit.
