Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Maintain the price at $2.05, which consistently results in the highest sales volume and profit ($39.32).
2. As a next step, incrementally test higher prices (e.g., $2.07, $2.08) to gauge customer response and determine potential profit increases.
3. Continuously track sales volumes and profit metrics to assess the impact of any price adjustments.
4. Monitor competitor pricing strategies regularly, especially any adjustments at or above $2.25, to understand market positioning.
5. Document findings promptly and review pricing strategies quarterly based on performance metrics and market conditions.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. The price of $2.05 results in the highest sales volume (37.44 units) and profits ($39.32).
2. Prices above $2.05 consistently show a decrease in sales volume and profit, highlighting strong price sensitivity.
3. Competitor pricing is set at $2.25, and maintaining competitive pricing is critical for market share.
4. Testing prices incrementally above $2.05 (such as $2.07 or $2.08) will help identify if there's room for pricing flexibility without jeopardizing sales.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The analysis of both sales data and previous pricing results shows that the price point of $2.05 yields the highest sales volume and profit. While testing higher prices, such as $2.10 and $2.15, has resulted in decreased quantities sold and profit, demonstrating strong price sensitivity among customers. The latest data suggests that a price increase to $2.10 results in stagnant sales and profit. Given this context, my recommendation will be to return to the price point of $2.05, which has proven consistent profitability. Another important factor is to continue monitoring competitor prices and remain aware of market dynamics in order to maintain competitiveness.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price back to $2.05, maintaining the highest recorded sales volume and profit margin.
2. Regularly monitor the effects of being at this price point on sales volume and profit.
3. Re-evaluate potential price increases based on competitor analysis and market conditions over the next quarter.
4. Test small incremental changes (like $2.07 or $2.08) later to observe possible changes in demand without immediately impacting sales.
5. Document and analyze sales data to refine future pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.05 remains optimal for maximizing profit with steady sales volume and profit margins.
2. Incremental price increases have led to decreased sales volume and lower profits, indicating strong customer price sensitivity.
3. The competitor’s price point should continue to be monitored, ensuring competitive positioning while focusing on sustaining profitability at the current price.
4. Continuing to analyze customer response to pricing strategies will guide decisions on potential future price adjustments.

My chosen price:
2.05
