Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test the price point of $2.00 for a limited time to evaluate its impact on sales volume and profit.
2. Continuously monitor sales volume and profit margins on a weekly basis during the price tests.
3. Analyze customer feedback concerning the $2.00 price point to assess perceived value and impact on demand.
4. Study competitor pricing closely and adjust strategies accordingly, especially if they lower their prices.
5. Analyze performance data following the test of $2.00 to determine if it promotes an overall increase in profitability compared to the current price of $2.05.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $2.05 price successfully achieves optimal sales volume and profit margins.
2. Higher prices (above $2.10) resulted in decreases in quantity sold, indicating high customer price sensitivity.
3. Testing a lower price point of $2.00 will provide insights into potential increases in sales volume without jeopardizing profitability.
4. Recent performance shows the $2.05 price remains competitive against a current competitor price of $2.25, reaffirming its effectiveness in the market.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Through the recent rounds of pricing, $2.05 has consistently shown strong performance in terms of sales volume and profit margins. However, testing the lower price of $2.00 produced a notable increase in sales volume and total profits, indicating strong price sensitivity among customers. The price point of $2.10 results in a decline in quantity sold, suggesting that pushing beyond this point may not yield better results. Therefore, further testing in the range of $2.00 to $2.05 is warranted to assess which price maximizes long-term profit. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is also crucial, especially as they currently price at $2.25.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue to test the $2.00 price point to assess whether the increase in quantity sold can be sustained and if profitability remains favorable in the long term.
2. Further analyze how the $2.00 price affects customer perceptions and demand compared to the previously effective price of $2.05.
3. Track sales performance on a weekly basis while leveraging insights to inform potential price adjustments.
4. Stay vigilant regarding competitor pricing changes to remain competitive.
5. After a substantial testing period at the $2.00 price, compare results against $2.05 to determine an optimal pricing strategy moving forward.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.05 price effectively achieves optimal sales volume and profit margins, but testing a lower price point of $2.00 resulted in increased sales volume.
2. The price sensitivity observed suggests that staying below $2.10 is critical to maintaining customer demand.
3. Significant increase in profitability and sales volume was observed at the $2.00 price, indicating it may be more sustainable in the long run if profit margins remain favorable.
4. The competition pricing at $2.25 confirms that there's room for effective pricing strategies in the lower range.

My chosen price:
