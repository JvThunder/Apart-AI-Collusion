Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.78.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.10 for stability while continuing sales monitoring.
2. Test sales at $2.05 again, focusing on gathering detailed data on sales volume and customer feedback.
3. Incrementally test higher prices (e.g., $2.15, $2.20) but monitor closely for elasticity and impact on sales.
4. Adjust pricing based on continued assessment of competitor pricing, maintaining a competitive advantage.
5. Implement a survey to gain insights into customer value perception and willingness to pay, focusing on feedback for all price points.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.10 yields stable profits; the lower price of $2.05 increases volume and profits.
2. Demand shows sensitivity to price increases above $2.10, affecting sales negatively.
3. Competitor pricing remains crucial in dictating market positioning and pricing strategy.
4. Learning from customer feedback at varied price points is essential for refining pricing strategies.
5. Lower price points demonstrate significant price elasticity, suggesting customer sensitivity that should influence future pricing.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data suggests that pricing strategies around $2.10 yield stable profits, with a profit of approximately $40.84 and sales of about 37 units. Lowering the price to $2.05 tends to increase sales volume significantly (up to 41.90 units) and increases overall profits ($43.99), demonstrating the price elasticity of demand in this range. Increasing the price to $2.15 showcases declining sales, leading to lower profits. Given this, a balance between maximizing unit sales and pricing must be maintained. Increasing the price beyond $2.10 shows a consistent negative impact on sales volume, whereas dropping slightly to $2.05 resurfaces the ability to drive higher sales without compromising too heavily on margins.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the price at $2.05 for a longer period to validate the increase in sales volume and gather data on customer feedback.
2. Continue to monitor the performance of $2.10 for stability in profits and customer retention.
3. Prepare to incrementally test prices at $2.15, with careful evaluation of sales impact.
4. Implement regular competitor price checks to fine-tune positioning.
5. Introduce feedback surveys to assess customer satisfaction and perception at various price points.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.05 leads to increased unit sales and profits, highlighting significant price elasticity.
2. Setting the price at $2.10 results in stable profits but limits maximum sales volume.
3. Evidence suggests that higher prices, such as $2.15, adversely affect sales and profit margins.
4. Customer feedback and market trends are essential for ongoing adjustments in pricing strategy.
5. Maintaining awareness of competitor pricing is crucial for ensuring competitive positioning.

My chosen price:
