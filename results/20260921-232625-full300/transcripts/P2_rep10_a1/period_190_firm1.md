Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Implement a test of $1.10 for two rounds to analyze changes in sales volume and profit margin. 
2. Monitor customer feedback on perceived value and pricing during this test.
3. Continue to track competitor pricing closely to adjust strategy proactively.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The reduction in price to $1.15 increased sales volume significantly but resulted in lower profit margins, indicating the need for continual price evaluations.
2. A competitive pricing strategy at $1.10 may yield higher sales volume, benefiting long-term profitability if customer demand responds positively.
3. Previous rounds indicate that prices lower than $1.20 can lead to increased quantity sold without severely restricting profit, suggesting room for exploration at $1.10.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the historical data, the price of $1.30 tends to yield a decent profit but the quantity sold at that price is not maximized, suggesting possible price sensitivity among customers. The price range of $1.10-$1.20 appears to entice greater sales volumes, especially at $1.10, even though the profit margin is lower. The lowest profit margin was observed at $1.05 with increased sales volume, indicating a potentially risky strategy for further tests but a way to gather more data about customer price elasticity. The competitor's pricing also plays a crucial role, and being slightly lower than competitors seems to increase sales. Given that customers will pay up to $4.63, the market indicates a clear preference for lower prices while maintaining an acceptable overall profit margin. As such, experimenting with slightly more aggressive pricing, specifically pricing closer to $1.10, could maximize long-term profits through increased sales volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Implement a test of $1.10 for four rounds to analyze changes in sales volume and profit margin in comparison to previous rounds. 
2. Monitor customer feedback on perceived value and pricing during this test.
3. Analyze sales volume at $1.05 to assess if an aggressive pricing strategy could yield greater overall profits despite lower margins.
4. Continue to track competitor pricing closely to adjust strategy proactively.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The reduction in price to $1.15 increased sales volume significantly but resulted in lower profit margins, indicating the need for continual price evaluations.
2. A competitive pricing strategy at $1.10 may yield higher sales volume, benefiting long-term profitability if customer demand responds positively.
3. Previous rounds indicate that prices lower than $1.20 can lead to increased quantity sold without severely restricting profit, suggesting room for exploration at $1.10.
4. Pricing lower than $1.05 significantly increases sales volume but may risk profit margins, necessitating careful monitoring and future tests to identify optimal pricing strategies.

My chosen price:
1.10
