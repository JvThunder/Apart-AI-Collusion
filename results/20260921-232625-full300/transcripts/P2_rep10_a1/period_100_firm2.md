Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Test the price at $1.30 to observe effects on sales volume and profitability relative to competitors.
2. Monitor customer feedback and competitor responses closely, especially at the $1.25 and $1.40 price points.
3. Conduct an analysis of sales performance at different price brackets, specifically focusing on the $1.20 to $1.40 range.
4. Explore implementing short-term promotional pricing strategies around $1.20 to attract customers.
5. Continue observing and analyzing sales and profit data to refine pricing strategies further.

- Sales at $1.50 suggest a diminishing return in volume, whereas $1.40 and $1.30 might unlock more sustainable profit potential.
- The price sensitivity observed around $1.25 and $1.20 shows potential for aggressive pricing strategies, but these should be managed to maintain margins.
- Capturing consumer behavior and preference data through feedback, especially regarding price changes, can significantly enhance pricing strategies moving forward.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Analyzing the previous pricing data, there's a clear trend where lower prices lead to higher sales volumes, but there are diminishing returns as prices drop. Particularly, the $1.20 to $1.30 price range shows consistent sales improvements with profitability potential. The most profitable price point noted was $1.25, achieving significant volume, while still providing a reasonable profit margin. Moreover, the price sensitivity around $1.25 suggests that it might be a strategic point to test promotions or additional marketing. Current customer feedback gathering will be crucial in understanding how price changes affect consumer perception and volume. Further experimentation in the $1.20-$1.30 range is warranted to ensure sustained profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the price at $1.25 to leverage previous successful sales volumes and profitability while capturing consumer interest.
2. Conduct a price elasticity test in the $1.20 to $1.30 range to better understand consumer response.
3. Implement a limited-time promotion around $1.20 to attract new customers and test market dynamics.
4. Continue monitoring competitor pricing strategies closely to adjust pricing as necessary while maintaining our value proposition.
5. Gather customer feedback on pricing experiences to refine future strategies and address any concerns promptly.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Previous sales reveal a strong relationship between lower prices and higher sales volumes, especially around $1.25.
- Identifying and capitalizing on price sensitivity can enhance profits without sacrificing margins.
- Continuous customer feedback is essential in aligning pricing with consumer expectations and demands in the competitive landscape.

My chosen price:
1.25
