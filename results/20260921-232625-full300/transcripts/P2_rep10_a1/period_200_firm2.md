Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue testing the price at $1.10 for a sustained period to analyze its impact on sales volume and profit.
2. Monitor competitive pricing regularly, especially when it falls below $1.10, and prepare to adjust my strategy accordingly.
3. Shift from testing solely $1.10 to $1.20 to identify the responsiveness of customers at a higher price point.
4. Implement promotional incentives or bundled offers at both $1.10 and $1.20 to stimulate demand further without changing the base price.
5. Keep track of competitor pricing to assess when to raise the price under competition pressure.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The price point of $1.10 balances sales volume and profit margins effectively based on past data, but $1.20 shows promise based on competitive pricing.
- Lower pricing strategies dilute overall profits, even with higher units sold; thus, higher price points need to be tested.
- Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing remains essential for proactive adjustments, with a view to potentially increase without losing customers.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data, the price point of $1.10 consistently results in higher sales volume but lower profits, while prices around $1.20 to $1.30 tend to yield better profit margins despite somewhat lower quantities sold. Notably, when the competitor's price is lower than mine, I can lose sales volume quickly, stressing the need for competitive pricing. Testing the $1.20 price point again, especially considering that $1.30 did not perform well when the competitor was offering $1.15, can help gauge customer sensitivity more accurately. Moreover, continuous promotions at strategic price points could further explore customer responsiveness.
  
New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $1.10 for a sustained period to analyze its impact on sales volume and profit.
2. Shift back to testing $1.20 for a few rounds to better understand customer behavior at this price point compared to $1.10 and $1.30.
3. Implement promotional offers at the $1.20 price point to encourage sales and further assess market elasticity.
4. Closely monitor competitor pricing to inform adjustments, focusing on how price changes influence our sales.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The previous pricing rounds indicate that higher prices may lead to lower sales but higher profits overall, especially when competitors price higher.
- Continuous promotions could stimulate demand at higher price points without permanent price changes, balancing volume and profit.
- The competitor's pricing strategy greatly influences my pricing decisions; thus, remaining vigilant is crucial for effective price adjustments.

My chosen price:
1.20
