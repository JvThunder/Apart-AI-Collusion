Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test the price point at $1.10 to evaluate how much additional volume can be sold while still maintaining reasonable margins.
2. Conduct a controlled test at $1.05 to better understand the price elasticity of demand and gather data on increased quantity sold.
3. Monitor competitor pricing regularly, particularly those hovering around $1.30, to ensure adjustments can be made proactively.
4. Continue observing customer feedback regarding value perception at these lower price points to draw parallels with sales outcomes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Price sensitivity is notably high below $1.20, suggesting greater customer interest and sales volume at these levels.
- Collaborating insights from sales data reinforce the potential of lower price points, especially around $1.10, where a notable increase in quantity sold is observed.
- Maintaining competitive pricing is critical; rapid adjustments as competitors lower prices can sustain profitability and market share.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the provided market data, the price sensitivity seems to be highest at lower price points below $1.20, indicating that reducing prices can significantly increase sales volume, thus affecting overall profit positively even with lower margins. Prices at $1.10 and $1.15 have yielded volumes above previous price levels. The competition at lower price ranges signifies a potential to capture a larger market share by being competitive. Additionally, considering the current competitor's pricing and the demand elasticity, continuing to test prices around $1.10 and $1.05 could yield valuable data on consumer response in a potentially competitive landscape.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the price point at $1.05 to gather data on demand elasticity and assess quantities sold against competitor prices.
2. Set a price point at $1.10 for a longer duration to observe sustained sales volume and customer sentiment.
3. Monitor competitors continuously to identify any strategic pricing moves and adjust pricing within a swift timeframe to maintain market share.
4. Evaluate the impact of pricing changes on customer perception of value, particularly at price points below $1.20.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Price sensitivity is notably high below $1.20, suggesting greater customer interest and sales volume at these levels.
- Collaborating insights from sales data reinforce the potential of lower price points, especially around $1.10, where a notable increase in quantity sold is observed.
- Maintaining competitive pricing is critical; rapid adjustments as competitors lower prices can sustain profitability and market share.
- Testing price points lower than the previous lowest observed ($1.00) could provide additional insight into demand sensitivity.

My chosen price:
1.05
