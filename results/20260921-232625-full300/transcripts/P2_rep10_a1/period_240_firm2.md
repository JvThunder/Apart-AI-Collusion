Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue monitoring the $1.10 price point for stability and steady profits.
2. Continue performing robust analysis at the $1.15 price point for insights into customer behavior and competitor responses.
3. Execute another short-term test at $1.05 to assess if quantity sold can offset lower profit margins.
4. Test pricing at $1.20, observing the impact on sales volume and profit.
5. Collect customer feedback on price sensitivity and perceptions regarding competitive pricing.
6. Perform a detailed analysis of current market competition across various price points, highlighting trends and shifts.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The $1.10 price point provides consistent profit and sales stability.
- The $1.05 price point enhances volume significantly but reduces profit margins, indicating strong customer price sensitivity.
- The $1.15 price is yielding a balanced outcome in terms of sales and profits, ideal for further analysis.
- Continuously observe competitor pricing; competitor prices hovering around $1.15 to $1.25 suggest potential pricing pressure in that range.
- Pricing strategies involving higher tiers ($1.20 and $1.25) result in higher per-item profits but decrease total quantity sold.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that the current strategy of pricing at $1.10 has been generating stable profits and sales. However, at the lower price point of $1.05, there is a strong volume increase, suggesting high price sensitivity among customers. The insights from previous rounds suggest that aggressive pricing can boost sales significantly, albeit at a lower profit margin. Conversely, pricing at $1.20 and above tends to yield higher profit per unit, but decreases in total quantity sold occur, as noted in several previous rounds. Moreover, the competitor's prices generally hover between $1.15 and $1.30, providing a little buffer to experiment with pricing. One option could be to test $1.05 further while also gathering valuable data on customer demand at that lower price point.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue monitoring the $1.10 price point for stability and steady profits.
2. Conduct additional short-term tests at $1.05 to understand volume increase versus profit margin reduction further. 
3. Perform trials at $1.15 and $1.20 regularly to ascertain responses, maintaining focus on the impact on sales and competitor pricing.
4. Gather and analyze customer feedback regarding price sensitivity and competitor perceptions, aiming for insights to develop future strategies.
5. Investigate reasons for decreased quantity sold at $1.20 and above; refine the pricing model around competitive levels.
6. Observe how pricing around the $1.15 to $1.25 range affects overall market presence and competitive positioning.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The $1.10 price point is providing consistent profits and sales stability.
- The $1.05 price point enhances volume significantly but reduces profit margins, indicating strong customer price sensitivity.
- The $1.15 price is delivering balanced sales and profits, ideal for ongoing analysis.
- Continuous observation of competitor pricing shows strong competition around the $1.15 to $1.25 range, signifying an opportunity for competitive pricing strategies.
- Higher prices (like $1.20 and $1.25) yield higher per-item profits but decrease total quantities sold, indicating a need for caution in the premium pricing strategy.

My chosen price:
