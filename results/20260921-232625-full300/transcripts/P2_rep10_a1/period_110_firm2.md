Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Conduct a new test by setting the price at $1.20 to validate its effectiveness against competitor reactions and sales performance.
2. Implement a temporary promotional offer at $1.10 to attract price-sensitive customers while closely analyzing sales volume and long-term revenue effects.
3. Monitor competitor pricing shifts, particularly within the $1.25 to $1.50 range, to gauge how they influence our sales and adjust our price accordingly.
4. Analyze sales data over the next three rounds to evaluate the sustainability and long-term impact of the new pricing strategies.

- Pricing below $1.50 tends to maximize sales, while profit margins can fluctuate based on competitors. Prices around $1.15 demonstrated significant sales volumes.
- Customers show high price sensitivity; minimal reductions typically lead to substantial increases in sales volume, underscoring the necessity of competitive pricing.
- The $1.10 to $1.25 price range remains optimal for maximizing volume and requires further exploration to confirm the best long-term strategy while being mindful of competitor pricing.
- A historical trend reveals that aggressive pricing strategies generate higher sales volumes, but care must be taken to assess their long-term viability and profit margins.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The past rounds of sales data reveal that aggressive pricing strategies, particularly in the $1.10 to $1.25 range, tend to yield higher sales volumes. Pricing lower than competitors generally leads to increased sales; however, consistent pricing around $1.50 has maximized profits in previous rounds. The temporary promotional pricing strategy to test the impact of $1.10 compared to competitors could attract more price-sensitive customers. I notice that while profit maximization is essential, maintaining a competitive edge through pricing flexibility appears critical given the noted customer price sensitivity.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Conduct a test by setting the price at $1.10 for one round to attract price-sensitive customers and evaluate the impact on sales volume and long-term revenue assessment.
2. After the test at $1.10, set the price at $1.25 for two rounds to confirm the sales volume effectiveness compared to previous results at this price point.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely within the $1.30 to $1.60 range, assessing how their strategies influence our sales and revenue.
4. Analyze the performance of $1.20 and $1.15 again to validate their effectiveness after our current tests.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Pricing below $1.50 tends to maximize sales, while profit margins can fluctuate based on competitor reactions. Prices around $1.15 demonstrated significant sales volumes.
- Customers exhibit high price sensitivity; minimal reductions typically lead to substantial increases in sales volume, emphasizing the necessity of competitive pricing.
- The $1.10 to $1.25 price range remains optimal for maximizing volume and requires further exploration to confirm the best long-term strategy while being mindful of competitor pricing.
- Historical data supports that aggressive pricing strategies generate higher sales volumes; however, we must evaluate their long-term viability and profit margins continuously.
- Recent tests indicate that pricing at $1.20 garners solid market response, but sustaining sales and profitability at this level needs further data analysis.

My chosen price:
