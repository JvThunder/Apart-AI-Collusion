Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.63.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price point of $1.10 to leverage its previous success against higher competitor prices.
2. Test a price point of $1.15 again to analyze its stability in terms of profit and sales volume.
3. Introduce a test of $1.05 as a low-risk strategy to analyze its impact on overall sales volume.
4. Closely monitor competitor price ranges and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
5. Gather and consolidate data from these tests for continuous refinement of long-term pricing strategies.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The $1.10 price point consistently yields high sales volumes and reasonable profitability, making it a crucial option for testing.
- The $1.15 price point has shown stability, balancing profitability and sales volume against competitors.
- Introducing a lower price point of $1.05 could help gather valuable data on consumer sensitivity to price, especially in comparison to competitors.
- Constant vigilance regarding competitor pricing will be essential in navigating different market scenarios effectively.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data indicates that lower prices generally result in higher sales volumes, confirming the sensitivity of consumers to price changes. The $1.10 price point has shown consistent performance in terms of volume and profit, but at $1.05, the quantity sold increased significantly despite yielding lower profits. The data shows that $1.20 and $1.25 are less competitive as they attract lower sales volumes compared to $1.10 and $1.15, especially against aggressive competitor pricing. Testing variations around $1.10, such as lower prices like $1.05, should provide insights into consumer price sensitivity. The current competitive landscape indicates that maintaining pricing between $1.05 and $1.15 might be beneficial for maximizing long-term profits, particularly given the competitor pricing strategies observed.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price point of $1.05 to gather data on sales volume and consumer price sensitivity, especially against a backdrop of $1.15 and Comparative competitors.
2. Continue evaluating the $1.10 price point due to its strong historical performance in volume and profit.
3. Introduce a price point of $1.15 and analyze its impact against competitor pricing to confirm its stability.
4. Analyze the impact of $1.20 and $1.25 as a strategy to understand the high-end consumer response but limit exposure due to low sales.
5. Monitor competitor pricing closely and adapt based on market responsiveness, focusing on long-term strategies that maximize overall profit.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The $1.05 price point provides a low-risk opportunity to analyze consumer responsiveness and sales volume without substantially compromising profits.
- The $1.10 price point remains a strategic anchor due to its track record of balancing the highest sales volume with satisfactory profits.
- Maintaining lower price points has proven to significantly increase sold quantities, showcasing consumer sensitivity.
- It is critical to remain responsive to competitor pricing as even slight reductions can lead to significant variations in sales volume.

My chosen price:
