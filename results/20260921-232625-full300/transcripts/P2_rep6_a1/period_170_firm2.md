Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Conduct tests at $1.12 to evaluate the balance of volume and profit against current competitor prices around $1.10 and $1.15.
- Examine customer feedback on price perception around the $1.05 to $1.12 range to identify perceived value.
- Explore slightly riskier tests at $1.15 and $1.19 to gauge elasticity and customer behavior at higher price points.
- Continue to assess performance at $1.10 to understand its impact on sales volume and profitability over time.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Prices around $1.10 to $1.15 have shown to yield better sales volumes while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
- Lower prices, while driving volume, negatively impact profitability; there's a balance to be found in price positioning.
- Customer feedback will be instrumental in adjusting perceived value against pricing strategies, particularly in competitive scenarios.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
- The market data indicates that lower prices tend to drive higher sales volumes. For instance, prices at $1.05 and $1.10 resulted in the highest quantities sold (63.81 and 58.91) despite lower profits.
- Competing closely with the competitor’s prices is important; prices like $1.10 and $1.12 have shown relatively stable sales and reasonable profits, balancing volume and revenue.
- The recent rounds suggest that a strategic price around $1.10 might be optimal, given its historical performance and customer response to competitive pricing.
- The tests around $1.15 did not drive significant increases in sales compared to $1.10 and may have resulted in lower volume sold at higher prices. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Conduct further tests at $1.10 to leverage previous successful sales data and evaluate its sustained long-term profitability.
- Continue testing small increments above $1.10 (such as $1.12) to see if slight increases can substantially affect margins without sacrificing volume.
- Collect and analyze customer feedback on perceived value at $1.10, preparing for future adjustments if higher sales volumes can be achieved through perceived value enhancement.
- Gather insights on the impact of further aggressive pricing at $1.05 to cross-check the volume versus profitability against higher pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Lower prices generally yield higher sales volume, but profits can be constrained as the margins tighten. A balanced approach is vital for sustainable profitability.
- Pricing closely to competitors, particularly at $1.10, leads to better competitive positioning, and yielding strong sales volumes can ultimately enhance total profits in the long run.
- Collecting customer feedback is essential to refine and potentially increase perceived value, which may allow for higher pricing without significant declines in sales volume.

My chosen price:
1.10
