Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue testing the price point of $1.05 for another week to confirm the correlation between this lower pricing and the resulting increase in sales volume.
2. Plan to test a price point of $1.10 for one week, focusing on the balance between quantity sold and profit margin.
3. Introduce a price point of $1.15 for observation, measuring the response of volume sold against changes in competitor pricing.
4. Explore the potential of a slight promotional pricing strategy around $1.10 to gather data on long-term sales trends.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing below competitors remains effective at increasing sales volume, particularly at the $1.05 price point.
2. Price points within the range of $1.10 to $1.19 have been noted to balance reasonable profit margins with changes in sales volume.
3. Observing competitors' pricing strategies closely is critical for optimizing pricing and profitability, especially when considering potential aggressive strategies.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that pricing below the competitor's price has consistently led to increases in sales volume. The price of $1.05 has proven particularly effective, achieving high sales with a moderate profit, while higher price points also exhibit varying success depending on competitor pricing. It's apparent that the current strategy of maintaining a price closer to $1.05, while testing slightly higher options around $1.10 to $1.19, is essential for maximizing profit margins given the fluctuating competitor prices. Moving forward, a pricing experiment at $1.05 appears conducive to volume sales, but I plan to test pricing strategies around $1.10 to $1.15 to gauge impacts on profit margins more intensely.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price point of $1.05 for one more week to confirm the correlation between this lower pricing and the resulting increase in sales volume.
2. Test different price points including $1.10 and $1.15 for one week each to evaluate the impact on sales volume against profit margins more thoroughly.
3. Monitor competitor pricing strategies closely while educatedly deploying occasional promotional pricing around $1.10 to balance between sales volume and profitability.
4. Explore the potential of including a lower promotional price strategy between the $1.00 to $1.05 range for one week to determine demand elasticity.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Maintaining pricing below competitors remains effective, particularly with the $1.05 price point generating higher sales volume.
2. The correlation between price and quantity sold aligns well with profit margins in the range of $1.10 to $1.19, as seen with lower sales at the $1.20 mark.
3. Continuous observation of competitors’ pricing strategies is critical for optimizing pricing and overall profitability.

My chosen price:
