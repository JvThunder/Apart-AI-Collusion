Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Test a price of $1.12 for three rounds to evaluate the impact on sales volume and profit margin.
- Follow this with a test price of $1.05 for three rounds to see if increased volume compensates for lower profits.
- Continue to monitor competitor pricing closely, especially for any significant adjustments that may inform future pricing strategies.
- After testing the above strategies, consider returning to a sustained price of $1.10 for a longer duration, contingent upon results from the previous tests.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- A price point of $1.05 notably drives sales volumes, indicating high price elasticity; however, profits are lower than at price points around $1.10 or $1.12.
- A consistent price of $1.10 yields stable sales and profits across multiple rounds, suggesting it might be an optimal price point.
- The $1.12 price point presents a promising opportunity for profit enhancement while maintaining a reasonably competitive position without deterring too many customers.
- Aggressive pricing strategies lead to lower profits and should be used with caution; they might be useful for data gathering but are not sustainable for long-term profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data and previous pricing strategies, the price point of $1.10 has consistently yielded stable sales and profits. However, there are indications that lower prices, such as $1.05, can significantly increase sales volume, although profits are reduced. It is important to note the effect of competitor pricing—when competitors lowered their prices, they managed to attract more customers away. The $1.12 price point provides a good balance of slightly elevated profits while still being competitive. Overall, testing a range of prices will yield valuable insights on price elasticity and customer behavior.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test a price of $1.12 for three rounds to evaluate the impact on sales volume and profit margin.
- Follow this test with a price of $1.05 for three rounds to further assess how increased volume compensates for lower profits, especially in competition with the lower-priced competitor.
- Continue to monitor competitor pricing closely for any significant shifts that may help inform further pricing strategies.
- Consider price testing strategies for $1.15 and $1.20 to evaluate the maximum pricing potential against customer demand and competitor pricing.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- A price point of $1.05 noticeably drives higher sales volumes, indicating considerable price elasticity; however, profits are potentially lower than with prices around $1.10.
- Consistent pricing at $1.10 shows stability in both sales and profits across multiple rounds, suggesting it may be an effective long-term price point.
- The $1.12 price point presents an opportunity for enhanced profits while maintaining competitiveness in the market based on customer responses.
- Aggressive pricing strategies should be employed with caution; while they can provide data for insights, excessive risk may not be sustainable for long-term profitability.

My chosen price:
1.12
