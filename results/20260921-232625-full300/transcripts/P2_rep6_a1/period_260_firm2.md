Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Continue testing price points below $1.10, specifically focusing on $1.01, $1.02, and $1.03, to assess their impact on sales volume and profitability.
- Aggressively respond to any competitor price changes, especially if they drop below $1.05, to maintain competitiveness and capture market share.
- Systematically document sales and profits at each price point to identify patterns and potential optimal pricing strategies moving forward.
- Experiment with a slightly lower price of $1.00 to gauge the effect on sales volume; this could provide valuable data for future pricing decisions.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Price points below $1.10 have shown to maximize sales, with $1.01 leading to the highest volume sold in recent rounds.
- Increasing the frequency of testing lower price points allows for better understanding of price elasticity among consumers.
- The current competitor pricing strategy suggests that undercutting prices while maintaining product quality can be a viable long-term strategy.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that pricing under $1.10 tends to maximize sales volume, with prices like $1.01 resulting in the highest sales observed. Profit margins are considerably low at lower prices, such as $1.00 to $1.02, and the profit earned does not cover the cost significantly. However, lower prices correlate with higher quantities sold. The optimal pricing strategy seems to balance volume with profit. The current competitive landscape indicates a willingness from competitors to adjust pricing in similar ranges, suggesting a more aggressive pricing strategy may be beneficial. Testing price points of $1.01 and $1.02 should continue, but there should also be attempts to maintain pricing above $1.05 and explore the impact of subtly increasing prices while monitoring competitor movements.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Continue testing price points at $1.01, $1.02, and $1.03 to assess their impact on sales volume and profitability.
- Evaluate the response to slight price increases such as $1.06 and $1.07 while analyzing sales data and adjustment of competitor prices.
- Document specific sales and profit data at each price point to identify effective strategies, particularly around the $1.05 to $1.10 range.
- Prepare to monitor sales closely if competitor prices fall below $1.05, and be ready to respond with aggressive pricing adjustments if necessary.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Price points below $1.10 optimize sales, with $1.01 resulting in the highest sales volumes so far.
- Low pricing strategies lead to reduced profit, but might be offset by the volume of units sold.
- Continuous testing of price elasticity is crucial; understanding how sales fluctuate in response to small price changes will inform future strategies.
- The need for adaptive responses to competitor pricing shows the market's dynamic nature; being flexible and ready to adjust can help capture market share.

My chosen price:
