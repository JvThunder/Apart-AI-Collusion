Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Conduct trials at $1.09 and monitor sales volume and profit to assess customer price sensitivity.
2. Continue A/B testing lower price points along with competitor comparisons to understand overall market position and further refine pricing strategy.
3. Maintain flexibility to adjust pricing based on competitive market movements and observed results from trials.
4. Gradually test $1.15 again after collecting sufficient data at the lower price points to find an optimal balance between volume and profit.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $1.15 price point still shows promise for balancing profitability and sales volume based on previous rounds.
2. Aggressive pricing trials at $1.05 and $1.09 yielded vital information on customer response, but must be balanced against profit margins.
3. Customer behavior reflects significant sensitivity to price changes, indicating that strategic undercutting of competitor prices might be beneficial when implemented thoughtfully to avoid margin erosion.
4. Continued monitoring and ready adjustments are essential as competitor pricing remains dynamic.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data indicates a significant response to changes in price. Testing aggressive low pricing strategies has been fruitful, especially at the $1.05 and $1.09 levels, indicating strong demand sensitivity. The profits are lower at these prices, but increasing quantity sold could compensate. It’s also important to note that some customers respond positively when prices are similar or slightly below competitors, as evidenced in rounds where profit varies significantly around competitive pricing. The areas where the $1.15 price point was tested also hint at reasonable outcomes for maintaining sales volumes while supporting greater profit margins than the lower prices. I recommend focusing on a dynamic strategy balancing price drops with sustained monitoring of competitor actions.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Conduct aggressive trials at $1.05 and $1.09 again to assess updated sales volume and profit, considering current market fluctuations.
2. Test the $1.15 and $1.17 price points simultaneously, using them as benchmarks to compare against lower price trials for optimal strategies.
3. Maintain a competitive edge by monitoring competitor pricing closely, adjusting my prices in response to their movements dynamically.
4. Gather data from the current trials before reassessing higher price points such as $1.19, to understand their profitability under the new market conditions.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Prices around $1.09 and $1.05 resulted in noticeably higher quantities sold but lower profits; this trade-off must be monitored for potential average profit maximization.
2. The $1.15 price point continues to serve as a potential optimal middle ground, balancing profitability with competitive standing.
3. Regular trends show that customers exhibit considerable price sensitivity, making it worthwhile to explore shifting towards lower price points when necessary.
4. A comprehensive analysis of sales volume at various price points will guide future pricing strategy and assist in identifying the sweet spot for maximizing long-term profits.

My chosen price:
1.09
