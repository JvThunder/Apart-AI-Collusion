Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price of $1.19 to maximize current profit as it has consistently resulted in higher earnings compared to lower prices.
2. If sales volume responds favorably at $1.19, incrementally test higher prices (e.g., $1.20 and $1.25) in subsequent rounds to determine the elasticity of demand.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely, especially when adjusting prices above $1.19, to see if there are shifts in customer behavior or preferences.
4. Maintain a variation of lower price points ($1.09, $1.05) to understand the trade-offs between volume and profitability, especially under different competitive pressures.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The pricing strategy should leverage the observed profit at $1.19 while keeping an eye on substitutes and competitor prices.
2. Customer price sensitivity appears pronounced; small adjustments upwards may not drastically lower volume, so there is room to explore higher price points.
3. Extensive testing reveals that lower prices yield higher volume but do not guarantee overall profit maximization, as demonstrated through consistent profits at higher prices.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy of $1.19 has shown consistent profits, particularly in competitive environments where slight adjustments in price are being met with shifts in quantity sold. The data suggests that the price elasticity of demand is relatively favorable, allowing for potential price increases without a significant drop in sales volume. Additionally, testing lower price points like $1.09 and $1.05 shows increased volume but significantly reduced total profits, suggesting a careful balance must be achieved. Given the price sensitivity observed, it may be worthwhile to continue testing higher price points near the $1.25 range, as it still remains below the competitor's higher prices, potentially capturing a larger market share while maximizing profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.19 to maximize current profit, as it has demonstrated consistent earnings.
2. Incrementally test higher prices (e.g., $1.20, $1.25, $1.30) to assess the elasticity of demand, monitoring any customer responses closely.
3. Continue to analyze competitor pricing while adjusting my own prices to see how volume and profitability respond.
4. Maintain lower price points ($1.09, $1.05) strategically on occasion to understand trade-offs between volume and profitability under different competitive pressures.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The pricing strategy should leverage the observed profit at $1.19 while monitoring substitutes and competitor prices closely.
2. Customer price sensitivity indicates that smaller price increases may not greatly reduce volume, suggesting there is room to explore higher price points.
3. Testing with different price points shows a trend where higher prices yield better profit margins despite a potential dip in volume, indicating a complex relationship between pricing, volume, and competitor responses.

My chosen price:
