Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Test a price of $1.20 while observing how it performs against competitive pricing. Measure changes in sales volume and profit margin.
- Simultaneously trial a lower price of $1.10 to assess if increased quantity sold offsets the profit margin loss.
- Continue analyzing the competitive landscape regularly to refine pricing strategy based on immediate market responses.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Pricing below $1.30 significantly improves customer demand, particularly around $1.10 and $1.20, with strong sales figures indicating a responsive market.
- Monitoring competitor pricing is crucial, as their pricing strategy directly influences our sales volume and profit margins.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the data provided, it's clear that pricing below $1.30 significantly boosts sales volume, especially around the $1.10 to $1.20 range. The most recent profitable prices have hovered around $1.10, suggesting that a lower price point might be preferable in order to maximize sales and profit potential, despite the lowered profit margin per unit. Exploring price points between $1.05 and $1.25 could yield valuable insights, particularly the optimal balance between volume sold and profit earned. Continuing to monitor competitor pricing and demand responsiveness is crucial as we test new lower price levels to inform future adjustments.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test a price of $1.10 to see if this increases volume sold sufficiently to offset the lower per unit profit. Measure changes in sales volume and profit margin compared to the previous rounds.
- Experiment with a slightly higher price of $1.25 to monitor if perceived value increases while still retaining reasonable demand. Compare sales data to illustrate the effects of solidifying a minimum price threshold.
- Conduct regular analysis of competitors to gauge how changes in their pricing strategies affect our market share and customer demand.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Establish pricing experiments below $1.20, especially at $1.10, potentially leading to increased sales volume and overall profit.
- Competitor price changes can drastically shift customer buying behavior; thus, adaptability in pricing strategies is vital to maintain or capture market share.

My chosen price:
1.10
