Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue testing the price at $1.17 for two weeks to evaluate its impact on sales volume and profit margins.
2. If sales remain stable at $1.17, consider testing the price at $1.15 to further probe the price sensitivity of customers.
3. Maintain vigilance on competitors' prices, especially those pricing around $1.10, and adjust prices accordingly to retain market competitiveness.
4. Plan a series of aggressive lower price tests (e.g., $1.10) for a week to analyze shifts in volume sales and their effect on overall profit.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing at $1.19 has consistently shown higher profits with decreased sales volume; offers a strong upper limit.
2. The $1.17 price point has balanced good profit margins with reasonable sales volume, indicating potential as a stable pricing strategy.
3. Testing lower prices like $1.10 yields increased sales volume but limited profitability, suggesting strong price sensitivity among consumers.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential for maintaining attractiveness and adjusting price strategies effectively.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
- The previous pricing data indicates that lower prices tend to produce higher sales volumes but can reduce profitability. For example, pricing at $1.10 saw substantial quantities sold, but lower profits. Conversely, the price at $1.19 has generated strong profits with fewer sales, indicating a higher price elasticity. The price of $1.17 has shown a good balance, but competitor pricing trends must be continuously monitored to avoid loss of market share.
- The pricing strategy of $1.15 has been effective, showing consistent sales and profit margins. The need to test lower price points further could lead to beneficial data on consumer price sensitivity.
- The data for aggressive pricing strategies (like dropping to $1.05 for a short duration) indicates they can lead to higher sales volumes but significantly lower profits.
- A strategic plan could involve maintaining a price of $1.17 for stability while also experimenting with the potential of a lower price at $1.10 to gather more data.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $1.17 for another two weeks to assess the long-term impact on sales volume and profits.
2. Test the more aggressive price point of $1.10 for one week to collect data on the potential increase in sales volume.
3. Continuously monitor competitor pricing, especially around the $1.10 and $1.15 marks, to ensure competitive positioning.
4. Analyze the results of the $1.10 test to guide future pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $1.19 yields strong profits but results in reduced sales volume, indicating the potential for price elasticity in the upper range.
2. The price of $1.17 maintains a good balance between profitability and sales volume, suggesting it as a viable stable pricing option.
3. Lower price experiments (e.g., $1.10) yielded higher sales volumes but with diminished profitability, underscoring consumer price sensitivity.
4. The importance of competitor price analysis is highlighted, affecting pricing adjustments that could retain market competitiveness.

My chosen price:
