Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.58.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Test pricing at $1.15 to balance sales volume and profit margin. Monitor customer response closely at this price to evaluate elasticity.
- After testing $1.15, consider testing $1.20 and $1.25 again to observe effects on sales and profit margins.
- Continue monitoring competitor pricing closely to inform future pricing adjustments.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Strong correlation between lower price points and increased sales volume indicates that aggressive pricing can be beneficial in capturing market share.
- Price elasticity may lead to different profit margins; thus, testing a price of $1.15 should provide a good balance between sales volume and profitability.
- Past data suggests that $1.29 provided the best blend of sales and profit; hence, understanding customer response to lower prices is critical for future pricing strategies.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that lowering prices generally results in higher sales volumes. The price of $1.29, while previously seen as a good compromise, doesn't seem to take full advantage of the market elasticity observed at lower price points. Testing lower prices such as $1.15 and $1.20 provided modest profits but were not fully maximized. The most notable sales volume and reasonable profit occurred at the price of $1.49 in Round 3, suggesting that there is room to further experiment with prices below $1.29 to drive profitability. Testing aggressive pricing pushes is warranted, as seen in the correlation of price reductions to significant increases in sales volume in earlier rounds.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test pricing at $1.15 again to determine if the previous data was an anomaly or a reaffirmation of sales volume increase within this point.
- Follow up with testing the price of $1.10 as a more aggressive strategy to further probe the upper limits of profit with lower pricing.
- If results at $1.10 are favorable, consider evaluating customer response at $1.05 to capture further market share.
- Continually observe competitor pricing to adapt strategies based on their movements.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The best sales and profit occurred at the price of $1.49, signaling that further testing is needed to determine if a more aggressive pricing model could surpass that.
- Lowering prices leads to increased sales volume, thereby allowing potential increases in production and market share despite reduced individual profit margins.
- Aggressive pricing strategies may yield marketing advantages if competitors cannot meet lower price points without incurring losses.

My chosen price:
1.10
