Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.76.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Continue testing at $1.12 to gather more data on its effectiveness in balancing sales volume and profitability.
- Assess sales data for the next rounds to evaluate the sustainability of price points around $1.10 and $1.15, especially if $1.12 shows stability.
- Implement a direct comparison round at $1.10 to see if it maintains a similar sales volume while providing a better profit margin.
- Explore pricing slightly lower, e.g., $1.03 to understand how aggressive pricing fares against competitors for more data on customer elasticity.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Pricing strategies between $1.05 and $1.15 produce reasonable quantities sold but demonstrate variability in profit margins; optimal price balancing requires further assessment.
- Continual analysis of competitive pricing can inform strategic decisions on price adjustments to maintain a profit margin above production costs while maximizing units sold.
- Gathering comparative data on price points such as $1.10 could reveal insights about consumer preferences relative to competitive pricing.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing data suggests that aggressive pricing strategies in the lower range (specifically around $1.05 to $1.10) tend to yield higher sales volumes, even if profit margins are lower. For example, when priced at $1.05, there's been significant sales volume, though profits are not maximized. However, at prices like $1.10, there have been satisfactory sales volumes with better profit performance compared to lower prices. The most recent pricing at $1.12 shows stable quantity sold but needs further testing. The competitor's pricing strategy does impact our sales, indicating we should keep exploring more competitive pricing. Therefore, testing a price slightly below $1.10, like $1.08, could yield useful data without going too low.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Continue testing at $1.12 for the next round to further evaluate its sustained profitability and sales volume.
- Introduce a new pricing test at $1.08 to gather data on whether this slight reduction can still maintain competitive sales while improving profit margins.
- Examine sales data post-testing for $1.08 and $1.12 to see which consistently yields better results and if $1.10 could be the ideal mid-point.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The current competitive landscape influences the effectiveness of pricing strategies; adjusting pricing slightly lower than competitors can significantly impact sales volume.
- There is a trend of diminishing returns on profit as prices drop; careful balancing is needed for maximizing both quantity sold and profit.
- Prices around $1.10 seem to produce steady demand while allowing for a healthier profit margin than some of the lower price points tested.

My chosen price:
1.08
