Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.76.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Continue aggressive pricing testing with a lower price of $1.05 for the next round to gather more consumer response data, especially in comparison to the $1.10 price point.
- Analyze competitive pricing data to determine opportunities for pricing slightly below competitors while also considering how this affects volume sold and profit margin.
- Prepare to explore a potential gradual increase from the current lowest price of $1.05 up to $1.15 based on consumer response in sales volume against profit earned.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Consistent patterns indicate that aggressive pricing strategies enhance quantity sold significantly, but there needs to be a balance to ensure profitability.
- A price elasticity effect is observed around $1.05 and $1.10, reinforcing the value of undervaluing competitors to optimize sale volumes.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical sales and profit data suggests a strong correlation between lower pricing and higher sales volume. The aggressive pricing testing indicates that pricing at or below $1.05 can yield higher sales (as seen with round 62 and multiple rounds below $1.10). However, the profit margins also need to be carefully managed, especially at these lower price points, as demonstrated in rounds where profit is negligible or negative. Pricing strategies should continue to explore levels below $1.10, especially focusing on $1.05 for its apparent elasticity and potential for higher volume sales. Exploring a cyclical strategy that tests both aggressive pricing and slight price increases could offer insights on balancing quantity sold with profitability over time.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Continue testing the price point of $1.05 while monitoring customer reactions to sales volume and profit. This price has previously generated substantial sales volume.
- Investigate revisiting price elasticities progressively by testing around $1.05, $1.10, and gradually moving back to $1.15 in subsequent rounds.
- Consider implementing testing periods where the price point around $1.10 and $1.20 is readjusted based on competitor pricing and resulting data to refine pricing strategies over time.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The evidence highlights that pricing at $1.05 may optimize quantity sold, but low profit margins need to be balanced. Continued emphasis on aggressive pricing strategies will yield additional data.
- Price elasticity remains crucial; rounds showcase that sensitivity shifts around the $1.10 - $1.20 range, necessitating strategic pricing adjustments in future rounds.

My chosen price:
1.05
