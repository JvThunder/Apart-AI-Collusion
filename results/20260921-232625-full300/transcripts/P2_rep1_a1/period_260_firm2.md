Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.76.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Continue testing prices at $1.10 to leverage previous sales performance and observe trends in competitor pricing.
- Conduct further tests at $1.20 for several rounds to determine if increased pricing yields sustainable long-term profits despite lower sales.
- Execute limited price testing at $1.25 and $1.30 while maintaining vigilance over competitor price dynamics and resulting sales volumes.
- Consider aggressive slashing to $1.05 to ascertain if a significant sales uptick can recuperate lost profits, while weighing the overall risks involved.
- Follow up with a review of customer feedback or market trends for pricing at $1.15 to understand its potential as a median option.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Pricing strategies around $1.10 continue to present a resilient balance between sales volume and profit margins, fostering long-term profit generation.
- There is significant evidence that cautious elevation of price to $1.20 can lead to higher profits, albeit at the risk of reduced units sold.
- Conducting experiments with pricing adjustments below the established norm requires monitoring to mitigate adverse long-term effects on overall profitability while understanding the competitive atmosphere. 
- Elevating prices to $1.25 might unlock new profit opportunities, particularly against less aggressive competitor pricing.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The pricing data shows that a price point around $1.15 often results in a good balance of sales volume and profit, suggesting it is a strong candidate for maximizing long-term profits. However, at $1.20, there is evidence of stable profits despite lower quantities sold, indicating that some customers are willing to pay more. Testing lower prices like $1.05 yielded higher sales volume but significantly lower profits. Competitor pricing is consistently lower, which suggests a need to remain competitively priced. My strategy will include experimenting with moderate price adjustments that gather insights about price elasticity. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test pricing at $1.15 continuously while monitoring sales volumes and profits over several rounds to understand its viability as a long-term price point.
- Explore aggressive pricing strategies at $1.10 to gauge if it can increase sales volume further while still being profitable when compared to competitors.
- Execute a round of tests at $1.25 to assess its impact on profits and units sold, ensuring to observe any competitor reactions carefully.
- Evaluate responses from customers regarding desire and willingness to pay at price points of $1.20 and $1.15 to better understand positioning in the market.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- A price point of $1.15 is consistently yielding a favorable balance of volume and profit, indicating potential for sustained sales.
- Pricing strategies at $1.10 may increase overall sales volume, but care must be taken to monitor the profit margins.
- At $1.20, customers appear willing to pay higher prices, leading to better profits despite lower quantities sold, emphasizing customer price sensitivity.
- Testing aggressive lower prices like $1.05 brings increased unit sales but significantly reduces profit margins, suggesting this strategy may not be sustainable long-term.

My chosen price:
1.15
