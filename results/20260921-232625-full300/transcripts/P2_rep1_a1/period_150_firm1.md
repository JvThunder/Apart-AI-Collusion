Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.76.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue to monitor and analyze sales performance at the $1.20 price point, especially if competitors deviate from established pricing strategies.
2. Test the $1.05 price point aggressively in conjunction with promotional campaigns to maximize volume.
3. Begin testing a $1.15 price point as a compromise between increasing sales volume and maintaining higher margins in relation to competitor pricing.
4. Explore promotional offers at $1.25 to assess customer sensitivity and maximize additional customer insights.
5. Establish a regular schedule to review competitor pricing strategies, allowing real-time price adjustments based on competitive behavior.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The $1.05 price point continues to show increased sales volume, but profit margins are significantly low, indicating a risk-reward scenario that needs careful management.
- The $1.20 price point appears sustainable but could be enhanced by periodically testing lower prices to gauge elasticity in demand.
- Customer sensitivity towards pricing is evident, especially when competing prices fluctuate; a key insight into gaining market share through strategic price adjustments.
- A stable but competitive approach at $1.15 could attract customers from competitors without drastically sacrificing margins.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the provided market data, the pricing strategy has fluctuated, showing various effects on both quantity sold and profit. The lowest price point of $1.05 has led to increased sales volume but low profit margins, indicating aggressive competition. The mid-range price of $1.20 has held a steady position, maintaining both reasonable volume and profit. The £1.25 and $1.30 points seem to yield diminishing returns as competitors are using lower prices to capture market share. With evidence suggesting customer sensitivity to pricing, testing several price points below $1.20, especially targeting $1.15 and promotional offers at $1.25, will help gather crucial data on demand elasticity. However, I also need to consider the risks of setting a price that is too low.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the $1.15 price point to find a balance between better sales volume and maintaining higher margins.
2. Conduct aggressive testing of the $1.05 price point with promotional campaigns to maximize volume and capture data on customer sensitivity.
3. Continue evaluating the performance of $1.20 and $1.25 pricing, as they have produced reasonable sales volumes and acceptable profit margins.
4. Implement regular reviews of competitor pricing to adjust our strategy dynamically based on market conditions.
5. Experiment with promotional offers—especially at $1.25—to test customer sensitivity and understand their willingness to pay.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The $1.05 price point is great for volume but jeopardizes profit margins, necessitating careful threshold management.
- The $1.15 pricing strategy may enhance sales volume without drastically sacrificing margins, making it a viable option.
- The customer sensitivity to price changes is evident and will require a continual examination of competing prices to capture market share effectively.
- Promoting at $1.25 could help size up demand elasticity for those who see value in higher price points but can be drawn in with promotions.

My chosen price:
1.15
