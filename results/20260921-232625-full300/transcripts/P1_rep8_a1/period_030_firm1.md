Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Continue to sell the product at $2.00 for the next pricing cycle to maintain stable sales data and profits.
2. Implement limited-time promotions or coupon strategies at $2.00 to gauge customer reactions without altering the base price.
3. Test price increments of $0.05 to $0.10 incrementally in the future while closely monitoring demand signals.
4. Conduct further market segmentation analysis to understand customer willingness to pay and explore targeting strategies.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continuing at a price of $2.00 remains a strong choice, yielding steady profit margins and consistent sales volume.
2. Slight price increases (e.g., $2.05) led to noticeable reductions in sales, highlighting significant price sensitivity among customers.
3. Lowering prices below $2.00 can boost volume but reduces profit margins, necessitating a balance between sales volume and profitability.
4. Promotion at the established price point can potentially lift sales without compromising profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that maintaining a price of $2.00 has consistently yielded stable profits and sales volume, demonstrating a balance between profit margin and customer demand. However, the slight price increase to $2.05 resulted in a noticeable decrease in sales, suggesting sensitivity in the customer base around price points. The optimal strategy would involve balancing price increases with maintaining acceptable sales levels. There is room to experiment with promotions or discounts to drive volume without changing the base price, as consistent sales at $2.00 have shown resilience. Future plans should also include incrementally testing higher price points while monitoring the impact on sales volume closely.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue to sell the product at $2.00 for the next pricing cycle to maintain stable sales data and profits.
2. Run targeted limited-time promotions or coupon strategies alongside the $2.00 price to evaluate customer price sensitivity and potentially boost sales.
3. Incrementally test price increases of $0.05 (e.g., $2.10) while closely monitoring demand and sales reactions.
4. Conduct market segmentation analysis to determine specific customer segments' willingness to pay, enabling tailored pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Continuing at a price of $2.00 remains a strong choice, yielding steady profit margins and consistent sales volume.
2. Slight price increases (e.g., $2.05) led to noticeable reductions in sales, highlighting significant price sensitivity among customers.
3. Lowering prices below $2.00 can boost volume but reduces profit margins, necessitating a balance between sales volume and profitability.
4. Promotion at the established price point can potentially lift sales without compromising profitability.
5. The current sales data indicates that prices above $2.10 may risk further drops in demand, indicating a critical threshold for pricing strategy.

My chosen price:
