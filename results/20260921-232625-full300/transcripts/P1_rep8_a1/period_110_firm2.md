Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Set the price at $2.40 to capitalize on increased sales volume and profit based on recent data.
2. Continue to monitor competitor price changes, especially if they drop below $1.85, and adjust pricing accordingly.
3. Gather customer feedback about the $2.40 price point to assess perceived value and demand.
4. Maintain monthly sales data reviews to refine our pricing strategies dynamically.
5. Re-evaluate the price point of $2.50 if competitive pressure increases, particularly in response to feedback or changes in market conditions.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data illustrates that the price point of $2.50 yielded strong sales and profits, particularly in rounds with competitor pricing at $1.85 and $1.80. However, the $2.40 price point has shown even better results, with profit maximization occurring at this level due to higher sales numbers. It's apparent that maintaining a competitive edge through constant monitoring of competitors and customer feedback is crucial. The recent analysis confirms that $2.40 is currently optimal, corroborating findings that suggest a price above $2.50 could negatively impact sales volume due to customer price sensitivity.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price at $2.40 to capitalize on increased sales volume and profit based on recent data.
2. Continue to monitor competitor price changes, especially if they drop below $1.85, and adjust pricing accordingly.
3. Gather customer feedback about the $2.40 price point to assess perceived value and demand.
4. Maintain monthly sales data reviews to refine our pricing strategies dynamically.
5. Explore lowering the price incrementally below $2.40 only if there's substantial loss in sales to ensure it reflects potential profitability. 

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.40 price point has shown the potential to drive higher profit through increased units sold.
2. Customers demonstrate significant price sensitivity; anything above $2.50 significantly impacts sales volume.
3. Continuous gathering of customer feedback at varying price points aids in aligning pricing with perceived value.
4. Regular analysis of competitor pricing, particularly below $1.85, remains crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.
5. Current data reinforces that price adjustments at or below $2.40 align with improved sales performance and overall profitability.
6. The price point of $2.50 showed strong results but could be superseded if competitors drop their prices. Therefore, $2.40 should be maintained when possible.

My chosen price:
2.40
