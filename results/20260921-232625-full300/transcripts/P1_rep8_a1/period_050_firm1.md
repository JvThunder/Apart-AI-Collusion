Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $1.85 for an additional sustained period to confirm stable sales and profit.
2. Explore the impact of price testing at $1.90 while monitoring sales volume and customer feedback closely.
3. Evaluate potential promotions or marketing strategies that could boost sales without sacrificing margins.
4. Continue monitoring competitor pricing and adjust our pricing strategies in response to notable changes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $1.85 consistently yields profits and stable sales around 63 units.
2. Higher prices of $1.90 reduce sales volume without significantly increasing profits, suggesting strong price sensitivity in the market.
3. Pricing above $2.00 leads to a notable decline in sales volume, pointing to an optimal price range below this threshold.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential for informed pricing adjustments.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data, the price of $1.85 has consistently yielded strong profits (approximately $54.10) with a stable sales volume of around 63 units. Increasing the price to $1.90 resulted in a decrease in sales volume to approximately 58.91, which also decreased profit to $53.01, suggesting price sensitivity in the market. Prices above $1.90 seem to diminish both sales and profit, as the past experiments show that increasing the price beyond $2.00 led to significant drops in quantity sold. A good strategy would be to maintain the price at $1.85 to solidify customer stability and then consider slight increments or promotions thereafter. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $1.85 for an extended period to confirm stable sales and profit.
2. Monitor customer feedback and competitor prices during this period.
3. Test a slight price increase to $1.90 after confirming stability at $1.85.
4. Explore potential promotional strategies to further boost sales without significantly reducing profit margins.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $1.85 consistently yields stable sales around 63 units and profits around $54.10.
2. Higher prices of $1.90 reduce sales volume without significantly increasing profits, indicating market price sensitivity.
3. Pricing above $2.00 leads to a decline in sales volume, suggesting that the optimal price range is between $1.85 and $2.00.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential for timely adjustments.

My chosen price:
1.85
