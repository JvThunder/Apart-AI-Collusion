Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing the price at $2.10 to confirm its effectiveness in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Plan to test a slight reduction to $2.05 in the next round to assess if a lower price can further boost volume while maintaining profitability.
3. Monitor customer feedback at the $2.10 price point to ensure customer satisfaction and perceived value.
4. Regularly review and compare sales performance against competitors to adapt to market dynamics, particularly noting the aggressive nature of competitor pricing.
5. Analyze data after an extended period at the $2.10 price point to make an informed decision about any future price adjustments.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The previous analysis shows that the price of $2.10 has been effective at maximizing sales volume and profit, particularly in comparison to higher prices like $2.20, which resulted in lower sales. The price reduction to $2.05 could help assess further price sensitivity. However, the steady profits around the $2.20 price indicate that the price thresholds may have been explored already, given how profits dropped at prices like $2.30. The optimal pricing appears to pivot around $2.10 - $2.20, with the ability to test slightly lower prices to understand market sensitivity better.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $2.10 to confirm its effectiveness in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Plan to test a slight reduction to $2.05 in the next round to assess if a lower price can further boost volume while maintaining profitability.
3. Monitor customer feedback at the $2.10 price point to ensure customer satisfaction and perceived value.
4. Continue to observe competitor pricing carefully, adapting strategy as necessary.
5. Analyze data after an extended period at the $2.10 price point to understand customer behavior and refine pricing strategy based on performance metrics.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.10 has proven to enhance sales volume significantly, maximizing overall profit in recent rounds.
2. At higher prices like $2.20, sales volume and profit decreased compared to $2.10.
3. The $2.10 price point is competitive within the current market landscape, particularly against competitors' prices.
4. Customer sensitivity to price changes suggests potential to explore minor adjustments for optimal sales.
5. Testing a price reduction to $2.05 could yield insights into customer price sensitivity and potential for increased sales volume.

My chosen price:
2.10
