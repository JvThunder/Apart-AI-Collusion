Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Set the price at $2.50 to maximize sales volume and profitability based on previous data.
2. Implement a limited-time promotion or marketing strategy at the $2.50 price point to enhance customer engagement and sales.
3. Regularly monitor competitor pricing, especially those near the $2.50 mark, to adjust our pricing strategy accordingly.
4. Continuously gather customer feedback on pricing perception and sales experience to inform potential future adjustments.
5. Experiment with temporary bundles or sales promotions at $2.50 to further attract customers while ensuring continued value.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that setting the price at $2.50 has consistently yielded high sales volume and profitability, especially when compared to higher price points such as $2.80 and $2.90. Sales data shows a significant drop in quantity sold at prices above $2.50, while maintaining robust sales at this price, even against competitors charging lower prices. Given the competitive landscape, maintaining the $2.50 price point seems essential for maximizing profit in the long run. The trend indicates a strength in demand at $2.50, particularly as evidenced by the quantities sold (4.58) at this price against competitors. The insights reinforce that immediate increases in price can hurt profitability through reduced sales volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price point at $2.50 to maximize sales volume and profitability based on previous data demonstrating higher sales at this level.
2. Implement consistent promotional campaigns around the $2.50 price point to sustain strong customer engagement and perception of value.
3. Closely monitor competitor pricing strategies as well as customer feedback regarding price sensitivity, especially in relation to price fluctuations below $2.50.
4. Consider testing small price adjustments (such as $2.55 briefly) to analyze customer behavior without detracting significantly from sales volume.
5. Continue experimenting with temporary sales or bundled offers around the $2.50 price point to enhance appeal and attract a wider customer base.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.50 price point has consistently maximized sales volume and profitability compared to higher pricing strategies.
2. Promotional strategies at the $2.50 price point enhance sales while maintaining perceived value among customers.
3. Price elasticity indicates strong demand around $2.50, emphasizing the need to avoid significant price increases.
4. Higher pricing strategies result in decreased sales volume, which negatively impacts overall profit margins.
5. Current data shows customer's willingness to purchase at $2.50 outweighs that at higher price points, affording the opportunity to focus on promotions and competitive analysis.

My chosen price:
2.50
