Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.20 as it has shown consistent success in maximizing both sales volume and profits.
2. Implement targeted promotional campaigns emphasizing the $2.20 price point to enhance visibility and encourage purchases.
3. Conduct regular elasticity analyses to measure customer demand and examine their willingness to pay above the $2.20 threshold.
4. Closely monitor competitors to ensure the $2.20 price remains competitive and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
5. Explore minor promotional strategies like discounts or time-limited promotions to evaluate their impact on sales without deviating from the main price point.

1. The $2.20 price point continues to yield high sales volume and profits, validating its position as our primary pricing strategy.
2. Higher prices, such as $2.50 and $2.70, lead to a notable decrease in sales volume, demonstrating unsustainable demand at those levels.
3. Lower price points, including $2.30, have shown some success but do not exceed the effectiveness of the $2.20 pricing strategy.
4. Competitive pricing remains crucial; staying around the $2.20 price helps attract customer interest and drive growth in comparison to competitors.
5. Promotions related to the $2.20 price can create urgency and interest among customers, potentially boosting short-term sales.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The $2.20 price point demonstrates consistent long-term success both in sales volume and profit, particularly when competing against prices lower than $1.80. At this price, the product remains competitive and attracts a significant number of customers. Lower price points, like $2.30 and $2.40, have also shown good results, but not as effectively as $2.20. Further exploration of promotional strategies tied to the $2.20 price might generate additional sales without jeopardizing profitability. Maintaining vigilance on competitors' pricing will be crucial as they often set the market tone, and engaging in analyses on price elasticity will refine our understanding of optimal pricing.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the $2.20 price as it has consistently maximized sales volume and profits.
2. Implement targeted promotional campaigns around the $2.20 price point to boost visibility and sales.
3. Conduct regular analysis of price elasticity to better understand customer sensitivity to price changes and assess their willingness to pay above the current price.
4. Monitor competitor pricing closely, ensuring that our $2.20 price remains competitive and attractive to consumers.
5. Consider experimenting with limited-time offers at the $2.20 price to increase urgency and spur purchases without compromising the baseline price strategy.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.20 price point remains the most effective for maximizing sales and profits.
2. Higher prices, such as $2.50 and $2.70, result in a significant drop in sales volume, indicating lack of demand at those levels.
3. Testing variations like $2.30 and $2.40 has not surpassed the efficacy of the $2.20 pricing strategy.
4. Competitor pricing analysis is essential; maintaining the $2.20 price helps attract customers amid competitive offerings.
5. Promotional efforts centered on the $2.20 price can generate increased sales, leveraging customer urgency and interest.

My chosen price:
