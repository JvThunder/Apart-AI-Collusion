Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $1.85 to confirm stable sales and profit.
2. Conduct further analysis on customer feedback regarding features and benefits to see if there’s potential for product improvement.
3. Explore the feasibility of promotional campaigns, such as limited-time discounts or bundle offers, while maintaining the $1.85 price point.
4. Test lower price points (e.g., $1.80 and $1.90) to evaluate any positive impact on sales volume.
5. Continue monitoring competitors’ prices to ensure competitive positioning and adapt pricing strategy as necessary.

1. The price of $1.85 consistently yields stable sales around 63 units and profits around $54.10.
2. Prices above $2.00 lead to a decline in sales volume, highlighting the need for careful price management.
3. Sales volume fluctuates significantly with minor price increases, indicating high price sensitivity.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitors’ pricing is essential for timely adjustments to the pricing strategy.
5. Promotional strategies and bundling could be leveraged to increase overall sales volume while maintaining profitability.
6. A price point of $1.90, although slightly higher, did not generate a proportional increase in profit, reaffirming the stability at $1.85.
7. Adjustments below $1.85 should be evaluated to maximize sales while maintaining profit margins.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $1.85 appears to consistently yield the highest profits due to stable sales volumes. Prices above $2.00 result in significant decreases in units sold, indicating strong price sensitivity among customers. Testing minor adjustments between $1.80 and $1.90 may yield insights into optimal pricing, but historical data suggests that lowering the price beyond $1.85 might not be beneficial for profit margins. Maintaining an eye on competitor pricing and possibly implementing promotional strategies could bolster sales further without adversely affecting overall profit.
