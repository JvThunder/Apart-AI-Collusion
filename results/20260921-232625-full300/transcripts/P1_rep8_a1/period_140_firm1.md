Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue to monitor sales data at the $1.85 price point but prepare to pivot based on performance metrics.
2. Transition to testing the $1.80 price point consistently for the next rounds, as it has shown potential for increased sales volume.
3. Reassess the $1.75 price point temporarily to evaluate its impact on sales and profits against the $1.80 price point.
4. Gather comprehensive customer feedback regarding price perceptions at various levels near $2.00.
5. Closely observe competitor pricing strategies and shifts to ensure we remain competitive in our pricing approach.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $1.80 price point shows the potential for higher sales volume compared to $1.85, indicating a possibly better profit margin when factoring in volume increases.
2. Continuous assessment of consumer price sensitivity is crucial, especially considering competitor prices.
3. The $1.75 price point yielded increased sales, but profit implications suggest it may not outperform the $1.80 price long-term.
4. Pricing decisions must adapt based on ongoing competitor behavior to maintain market relevance.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy has maintained a consistent price of $1.85 with stable gross profits but relatively static sales volumes in recent rounds. The transition to $1.80 demonstrated a potential increase in sales volume, suggesting it could be the optimal price point for maximizing profits when considering volume. The $1.75 price point was effective in boosting quantities sold but might lead to reduced overall profitability in the long run due to lower margins. It will be important to also monitor any shifts in competitor pricing, especially since our direct competitor seems to have a higher price, which may allow for some flexibility in our pricing. Hence, further testing around the $1.80 price point while also exploring a return to $1.75 for brief periods could help gauge the sensitivity of our customers to price changes.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the $1.80 price point consistently for upcoming rounds to further evaluate the balance between sales volume and profit.
2. Temporarily experiment with the $1.75 price point for one to two rounds to gather sales data and assess profitability implications against $1.80.
3. Collect comprehensive customer feedback regarding price perceptions, especially given the recent shift to $1.80 and the potential interest around $1.75.
4. Maintain surveillance of competitor pricing, particularly if they lower their price or if changes in consumer behavior are noted.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $1.80 price point maintains a good balance between a slight reduction in price and potential increases in sales volume, which could lead to enhanced profitability.
2. The $1.75 price point boosted unit sales but may not outperform $1.80 due to decreased profit margins per unit.
3. Continuous analysis of competitor pricing is vital for strategic positioning, ensuring we leverage our price advantage effectively without compromising our profitability.

My chosen price:
1.80
