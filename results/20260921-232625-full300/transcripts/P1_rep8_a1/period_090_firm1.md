Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.32.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing the price of $1.80 for at least three more rounds to assess its profitability and sales stability.
2. After three rounds, test the price of $1.75 again to determine if it maintains better sales volume compared to $1.80 while observing competitor reactions.
3. Investigate pricing strategies around $1.85 to see if slight adjustments can yield better margins while keeping customers engaged.
4. Closely monitor competitor price shifts, especially any drops below $2.50, to adjust pricing strategies accordingly.

1. The $1.80 price point has proven effective and stable, leading to persistent sales and profit margins.
2. Testing lower prices ($1.75) has yielded increased sales volume while maintaining healthy profit margins.
3. Data indicates that raising prices significantly above $1.90 leads to diminishing returns on profit due to a decline in sales volume.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing trends is essential to staying competitive and maximizing profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy at $1.80 has shown stability and a reasonable profit margin, with sales typically ranging around 66.22 units sold per round and a profit of approximately $52.98. Lowering the price to $1.75 had previously yielded a higher quantity sold (70.54 units) but resulted in a slightly lower profit margin ($52.90). Testing the price at $1.85 generated better profits ($54.10) although the volume was a bit lower. Competing against a market where prices can go up to $3.32 offers room for further adjustment. Therefore, experimenting with the $1.80 price point is recommended while considering if minor dips or bumps could yield a better combination of quantity and profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price of $1.80 for a minimum of three more rounds to assess its continued profitability and the stability of sales.
2. After three rounds at $1.80, test a slight price reduction to $1.75 to evaluate possible changes in sales volume and customer response.
3. Consider conducting tests at $1.85 to gauge whether higher margins can be sustained with manageable sales volume.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Current price point of $1.80 provides stability with decent profit margins.
2. A slight decrease to $1.75 shows increased sales volume, but profit margins are slightly lower than at $1.80.
3. Prices above $1.90 lead to diminishing returns; thus, maintaining competitive edge is crucial.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor's pricing remains essential for optimizing our pricing strategy.

My chosen price:
1.80
