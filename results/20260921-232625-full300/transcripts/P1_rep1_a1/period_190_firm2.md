Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data provided, it is clear that a price point of $2.00 consistently maximizes both sales volume and profits. The historical performance data indicates that quantities sold significantly increase at this price compared to higher price points. Specifically, the price of $2.10 results in decreased sales volume and profits. Additionally, insights suggest that price sensitivity is high, and price increments above $2.05 lead to a drop in sales. Therefore, resetting the price to $2.00 is a strategic move to ensure long-term profitability while maintaining a competitive edge against competitors priced at $2.05.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the product price back to $2.00 to maximize sales volume and profit based on historical performance.
2. Enhance marketing initiatives to highlight the $2.00 price point, emphasizing value to consumers.
3. Implement and promote limited-time campaigns to stimulate interest and drive sales at the $2.00 price without sacrificing profit margins.
4. Track and analyze sales metrics to ensure that the $2.00 price continues to yield optimal profitability.
5. Continue to monitor competitor pricing but prioritize maintaining the competitive advantage offered by the $2.00 pricing strategy.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Historical data consistently confirms that a price point of $2.00 maximizes both sales volume and profits effectively.
