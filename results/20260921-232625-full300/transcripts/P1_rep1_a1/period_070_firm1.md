Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.10, as it has historically optimized profit and sales volume.
2. Monitor sales volume, profit margins, and customer feedback closely to adapt strategies as necessary.
3. Continue promoting the price of $2.10 as the best value, emphasizing quality and reliability to enhance perceived value.
4. Consider testing a very cautious price increase to $2.15 in two months if sales remain stable, with thorough monitoring of market conditions.
5. Reassess pricing strategy based on updated sales performance data and market trends in two months.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.10 remains optimal for balancing profit margins and sales volume.
2. Lower prices (e.g., $2.00) lead to increased sales volume but significantly reduce overall profit.
3. Price increases above $2.10 tend to decrease quantity sold, indicating price sensitivity among customers.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitors' pricing strategies is essential to stay competitive without compromising profitability.
5. Customer feedback on perceived value is crucial for refining promotional strategies and sustained sales.
6. Testing slight price increases should be approached cautiously to avoid drastic drops in sales volume.
7. Promotion of $2.10 should continue to emphasize quality to enhance its perceived value.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data indicates that the price of $2.10 has consistently produced a healthy balance of sales volume (around 26-37 units sold) and profit margins (approximately $29.62 to $37.45). Pricing below this (like $2.00) yields higher sales volumes but significantly lowers profit, while higher prices (like $2.25 or above) cause volume drops and lower profitability. Thus, maintaining $2.10 seems optimal. However, it's important to test slight increases cautiously, especially given the competitor's price fluctuations. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue the price at $2.10, as it has historically produced favorable profits and sales volume.
2. Monitor sales volume, profit margins, and customer feedback rigorously to assess potential changes.
3. Prepare to test a cautious price increase to $2.15 in two months, depending on sales stability and competitor pricing.
4. Analyze any changes in customer feedback regarding value perception, especially if price adjustments occur.
5. Keep an eye on competitor pricing strategies to ensure competitiveness and responsive pricing actions.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.10 has consistently generated optimal profitability and sales volume.
2. Prices below $2.10 lead to increased sales volume but detract from overall profit margins.
3. Price increases beyond $2.10 tend to reduce quantity sold, indicating a sensitivity among customers and the risk of lost sales.
4. Continuous scrutiny of competitors' pricing strategies is necessary to avoid price wars and maintain profitability.
5. Customer perceptions of value are vital to refining promotional strategies and sustaining customer loyalty.
6. Cautious testing of price increases should be executed to prevent drastic sales reductions.

My chosen price:
2.10
