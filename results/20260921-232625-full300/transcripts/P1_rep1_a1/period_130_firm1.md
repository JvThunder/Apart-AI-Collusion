Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.05 to maximize long-term profitability, ensuring steady sales volume and high profit margins.
2. Continue to monitor competitor pricing closely; if they drop below $2.00, consider promotional strategies at $2.00 temporarily while still evaluating the overall impact on profit margins.
3. Assess customer feedback on value perception consistently to inform potential future adjustments and promotions.
4. Test the impacts of very minor price increases above $2.05 periodically to gauge customer tolerance and potential for higher margins.

1. The price of $2.05 has proven to be optimal for achieving maximum profitability with the highest sales volume and favorable profit margins.
2. Price sensitivity from customers indicates a marked decline in quantity sold when prices exceed $2.10.
3. Competitive pricing is crucial; adjustments should be made when competitors drop their prices to maintain market share.
4. Occasional assessments of customer feedback will provide valuable insights into value perceptions, potentially guiding price adjustments over time.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data shows that maintaining a price of $2.05 yields the highest profit and sales volume. When prices exceed $2.10, there is a noticeable decline in quantity sold. The price movements also indicate that a price of $2.10 leads to steady profits, but it appears the best performing price consistently is $2.05, especially when competing at the same price with competitor offerings. Given this competitive landscape, keeping the price at $2.05 or utilizing temporary discounts to match competitor pricing could maximize profit opportunities. Additionally, need to continuously monitor customer feedback on perceived value, as this can guide future adjustments.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.05 to maximize long-term profitability, ensuring steady sales volume and high profit margins.
2. Continue to monitor competitor pricing closely; if they drop below $2.00, implement temporary promotional strategies at $2.00 while evaluating overall impact on margins.
3. Regularly assess and incorporate customer feedback on value perception to inform potential future adjustments and promotions.
4. Explore the impact of very minor price increases above $2.05 to gauge customer tolerance for higher prices.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.05 has proven to be optimal for achieving maximum profitability with the highest sales volume and favorable profit margins.
2. Price sensitivity from customers indicates a marked decline in quantity sold when prices exceed $2.10.
3. Competitive pricing is crucial; adjustments should be made when competitors drop their prices to maintain market share.
4. Consistently gathering customer feedback provides valuable insights into their value perceptions, which can guide pricing adjustments over time.
