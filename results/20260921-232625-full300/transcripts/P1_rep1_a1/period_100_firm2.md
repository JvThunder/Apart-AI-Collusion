Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price of $2.10 for another week to observe customer reactions and sales volume.
2. After the week, closely analyze the data from this pricing to determine if an increase to $2.15 is sustainable based on sales volume and profit margins.
3. Implement a feedback mechanism targeting customers who purchase at $2.10 to understand their perception of value more deeply.
4. If results from $2.10 remain promising, conduct a cautious test of $2.15 while monitoring sales closely.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- A price of $2.10 has shown potential for improved profit margins without drastically affecting volume.
- The sensitivity of customers to price increases becomes pronounced above $2.10, warranting caution in future pricing strategies.
- Consistent customer feedback and monitoring sales data will enhance decision-making in pricing adjustments.
- Gradual price testing remains essential to understand customer elasticity without risking a sharp decline in sales.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data, the price of $2.10 has shown potential for generating stable profits but has resulted in a reduced quantity sold compared to lower pricing. Testing a price increase to $2.15 after observing the performance at $2.10 could help identify customer price sensitivity and maximize profit. Historical data suggests that the price elasticity of demand seems to be quite sensitive around the $2.10 and $2.15 range, so it's prudent to proceed cautiously with any price increase. Additionally, competitors’ prices at $2.10 and above seem to correlate with a decrease in the quantity sold, reinforcing the need for careful adjustment.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Secure a week at the price of $2.10 to further gauge customer response and sales volume.
2. Analyze the resulting sales data to assess the viability of a price increase to $2.15.
3. Execute customer feedback surveys focused on willingness to pay after purchasing at $2.10 to gauge perceived value.
4. If data supports it, cautiously test $2.15 for one week while closely monitoring the resulting sales impact.
5. If sales volume is sustainable or increases at $2.15, consider maintaining this price or gradually testing up to $2.20, ensuring to monitor sales closely for any negative trends.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.10 has yielded a solid profit margin, though the quantity sold reflects some elasticity in demand.
- A price increase above $2.10 may trigger a notable drop in sales, emphasizing the need for strategic pricing experiments.
- Continual customer feedback and analysis of sales data will enhance understanding of optimal pricing points.
- A cautious approach to testing incremental price increases is critical for protecting profit margins without alienating customers.

My chosen price:
2.10
