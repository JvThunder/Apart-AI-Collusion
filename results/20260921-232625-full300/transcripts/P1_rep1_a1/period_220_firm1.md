Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue price testing at $2.15 for additional rounds to gather further data on long-term profitability.
2. Evaluate the sales data from price points of $2.10 and $2.15 to understand their impact on quantity sold and profitability.
3. Implement aggressive marketing strategies or promotions at the $2.15 price point to assess effects on sales volume.
4. Collect detailed customer feedback about perceived value and price sensitivity before and after price adjustments.
5. Monitor competitor pricing regularly, especially if they make significant changes, to ensure competitiveness while maximizing profit.
6. Test a temporary lower price of $2.10 to compare sales response against $2.15 and analyze elasticity.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Consistent sales at $2.05 provide a steady volume but do not maximize profits effectively.
2. Higher prices, particularly at $2.15, should be further tested despite showing lowered volume, as they provide improved profit margins.
3. Consumer feedback is critical, particularly around how new pricing influences perceptions of value.
4. Keeping an eye on competitors' prices is necessary to adjust both market share and margin strategies effectively.
5. The recent test of $2.10 results indicates a delicate balance of sales volume and profit, necessitating further exploration.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.05 has provided a relatively stable profit, but it does not maximize profitability when compared to higher price points like $2.15. Recent tests at $2.10 indicate that while the volume sold dips, it still allows for a decent profit margin. Testing $2.15 has shown decreased quantities sold and lower profits per round. However, this price point still offers the highest margin. The consumer responses and competitor prices suggest a need for further experimentation. The business's overall performance at the higher end of the pricing scale indicates potential for profitability if the right strategies are employed, especially in terms of marketing and promotions.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price point of $2.10 to further analyze its effects on quantity sold and long-term profitability.
2. Conduct a rotation of price testing at $2.15 while implementing aggressive marketing efforts to boost sales volume.
3. Gather customer feedback on both price points ($2.10 and $2.15) to understand perceived value and price sensitivity better.
4. Monitor competitive pricing closely to adjust strategies and ensure the product remains competitive.
5. Consider the mid-range adjustment of $2.12 to evaluate customer reactions without fully committing to $2.15.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Prices around $2.10 provide a balance between volume and profit, while $2.15 offers the highest margin but with a lower sales volume.
2. Pricing strategies must include aggressive marketing and promotions to increase customer acquisition at higher price points.
3. Customer feedback is essential to understanding how the perceived value interacts with price elasticity in different market conditions.
4. Monitoring competitors will help strategically position the product and maintain profit margins.

My chosen price:
2.10
