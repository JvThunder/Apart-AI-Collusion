Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the product price at $2.00 to optimize sales volume and profit based on historical performance.
2. Monitor sales metrics to ensure the $2.00 price point continues to yield optimal profitability.
3. Implement targeted marketing campaigns to reinforce customer knowledge about the product's value at the $2.00 price.
4. Collect and analyze customer feedback to further understand price sensitivity and adapt strategies as necessary.
5. Continuously monitor competitor pricing strategies. However, remain committed to the $2.00 price unless significant market changes necessitate adjustments.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- A price of $2.00 triggers the highest sales volume and profit based on continuous historical trends.
- Raising prices above $2.05 leads to sharp declines in sales, showcasing substantial price sensitivity among customers.
- Engaging marketing strategies that emphasize the product's worth at $2.00 enhance consumer interaction and loyalty.
- It's vital to track competitors' prices, but the $2.00 pricing should remain the cornerstone of strategy for sustained profitability.
- Sustaining the $2.00 price leads to the most stable and consistent profit outcomes over time.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the historical sales data, the price of $2.00 consistently generates the highest sales volume and profit, with 35.48 units sold and a profit of $35.48 across multiple rounds. Furthermore, the data shows that prices above $2.05 result in significant declines in sales, indicating a strong price sensitivity in customers. Therefore, continuing to maintain the price at $2.00 seems to be the best strategy for maximizing profit in the long term. Additionally, while the competition priced at $2.05 has historically influenced sales, your consistent profitability at $2.00 suggests that customer loyalty and value perception remain favorable at this price point.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue to maintain the product price at $2.00 to optimize sales volume and maximize profit based on strong historical performance.
2. Monitor sales metrics to ensure the $2.00 price point remains effective in achieving profit targets.
3. Implement ongoing targeted marketing campaigns emphasizing the product's value at $2.00 to maintain customer engagement.
4. Collect and analyze customer feedback periodically to stay informed about price sensitivity and market changes.
5. Maintain vigilance on competitor pricing, ensuring competitive positioning while prioritizing the $2.00 price point until clear evidence suggests a necessary change.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- A price of $2.00 continues to trigger the highest sales volume and profit, appearing to be the optimal price point.
- Customers show significant price sensitivity, as evidenced by steep declines in sales when prices exceed $2.05.
- Successful marketing strategies that highlight the product's worth at $2.00 are crucial for enhancing customer loyalty.
- Regular monitoring of competitor pricing is necessary but should not distract from the proven profitability of the $2.00 strategy.
- Sustaining the price at $2.00 has led to the most consistent and stable profit outcomes over time.

My chosen price:
