Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.15.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue to monitor the sales performance at the current price of $2.05 for another week.
2. Conduct a feedback survey to gauge customer perception of price and value.
3. Research competitive pricing strategies to detect market trends or shifts.
4. Test a price decrease to $2.00 to analyze volume and profit impact.
5. Explore potential pricing experiments at $2.10 and $2.15, observing customer reactions.
6. Utilize competitor pricing data to adjust strategy consistently and ensure competitiveness.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The most recent sales data shows that maintaining a price of $2.00 has led to a consistent increase in units sold and profit earned. This suggests that at $2.00, the product is positioned attractively against competitors, leading to higher demand. Conversely, a price of $2.05 has resulted in stable but declining profits, indicating that it might not be optimally aligned with customer price sensitivity. Dropping to $2.00 has maximized profit in several recent rounds, particularly as competitor prices have not significantly undercut this level. Therefore, continuing to work at this price point while conducting further examinations (like customer feedback and competitor analysis) would be prudent.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Keep the price at $2.00 for another week to monitor sales volume and profits.
2. Conduct a feedback survey to gauge customer perception of the product's value at the current price.
3. Analyze competitor pricing regularly to identify strategic adjustments.
4. Consider testing a slight price increase to $2.05 after a period of solid sales at $2.00 to measure volume response.
5. Evaluate the impact of running promotional campaigns to further boost sales while at $2.00.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Maintaining a price of $2.00 has demonstrated significant sales volume and profit maximization.
- Repeated patterns indicate price sensitivity, revealing that customers favor lower price points over slight increases.
- Gathering direct customer feedback will aid in refining the perceived value and optimal pricing.
- Competitor analysis remains crucial to adaptability and sustaining competitiveness in the market.

My chosen price:
2.00
