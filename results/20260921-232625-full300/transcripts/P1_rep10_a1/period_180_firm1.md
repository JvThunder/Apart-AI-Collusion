Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows a consistent pattern in customer behavior, particularly a strong acceptance of the price point at $1.75, which has resulted in stable sales and profits over many rounds. The highest profits were observed when the price was maintained at $1.75, which indicates that further increases may lead to decreased sales volume due to sensitivity observed when prices approached $1.80 or above. Given that there is potential for slight adjustments to test responsiveness, experimenting with a gradual increase to $1.76 could be valuable, but it should be done cautiously and monitored closely to avoid losing momentum. Additionally, the competitor pricing suggests we should keep track of any shifts in their strategies, given the proximity of their prices to our own.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $1.75 for the next round to ensure steady sales and profit.
2. Explore a gradual increase to $1.76 while closely monitoring customer reactions and sales data.
3. Implement promotional marketing strategies to build and strengthen customer loyalty at the current price point.
4. Conduct a detailed competitor analysis to adapt our pricing strategies in the following rounds.
5. Continue gathering customer feedback to refine and optimize pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $1.75 continues to demonstrate strong customer acceptance and a stable sales volume.
2. Price increases above $1.80 correlate with a significant drop in sales, highlighting customer sensitivity.
3. Promotional efforts at the current price point have successfully maintained customer engagement and loyalty.
4. Monitoring competitors' pricing strategies will be essential for adapting to market conditions.
5. Regular customer feedback is crucial for optimizing pricing strategies and understanding customers' willingness to pay.

My chosen price:
