Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $1.75 has shown stability in terms of sales volume and profitability. Sales have varied slightly around this price but have not increased meaningfully with higher price options like $1.79 or $1.80, which indicates that customers may be sensitive to price increases. The consistent profit at $1.75 suggests it is a strong point for long-term profitability, particularly when compared to other price points that resulted in decreased sales. It is advisable to continue testing with promotional strategies and remain vigilant about competitors’ pricing. Incremental price adjustments should be approached cautiously.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Revert to the price of $1.75 and monitor sales and customer feedback closely.
2. Analyze sales data weekly to verify if $1.75 continues to maintain stable sales and profit margins.
3. Explore promotional strategies aimed at enhancing customer engagement at the $1.75 price point.
4. Track competitors' price changes to assess their influence on customer behavior.
5. Test small incremental price increases after a stabilization period at the $1.75 mark, observing customer feedback closely.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $1.75 has proven to be resilient in maintaining sales, indicating it is likely a strong point for profitability.
2. Higher prices, such as $1.79 and $1.80, resulted in noticeable declines in sales, suggesting a threshold beyond which customers may not be willing to purchase.
3. Continued promotional efforts at $1.75 can preserve customer engagement and potentially boost volume sales.
4. Competitor pricing strategies should be monitored as these may impact customer preferences and pricing tactics.

My chosen price:
1.75
