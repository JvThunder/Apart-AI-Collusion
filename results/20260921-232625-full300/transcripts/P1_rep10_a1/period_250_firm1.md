Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue monitoring sales and profit performance at the current price of $1.75.
2. Execute further tests on the price of $1.78, assessing the impact on sales volume and profit over an extended period.
3. Investigate the potential for a limited-time promotional campaign at $1.99 to gauge customer response while monitoring profit margins.
4. Collate customer feedback on pricing to refine our approach.
5. Review quantities sold against competitor pricing to adjust strategy accordingly while maintaining profitability.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $1.75 price serves as a reliable baseline with consistent profits.
2. Price sensitivity is evident; increases above $1.75 lead to decreased volume sold.
3. Testing $1.78 presents an opportunity to incrementally increase revenue while monitoring customer response.
4. The $1.99 price point is critical to explore as it aligns with competitive pricing and potentially captures increased market share, although initial tests show decreased sales volume at this point.
5. Balancing promotional strategies with profit maintenance is essential for future pricing adjustments.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $1.75 has proven to be a reliable baseline, consistently providing a profit of approximately $46.17 with a stable sales volume of 61.56 units per round. Although the introduction of the price point at $1.78 showed some profit potential, the sales volume dipped to 57.71 in certain rounds, indicating a moderate price sensitivity. Testing the higher price of $1.99 resulted in a drop in sales volume, suggesting that while this price aligns with competitor pricing, it might not be optimal for our target market. The potential for a promotional campaign remains intriguing, but past results indicate that crucial balancing between profitability and market attraction is necessary. To optimize profits, we must consider minor adjustments to price to explore elasticity effectively while ensuring we maintain a sustainable profit margin.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue monitoring sales and profit performance at the current price of $1.75.
2. Execute further tests on the price of $1.78 to fully gather data on customer responses and sales volume impact.
3. Investigate the potential for a limited-time promotional campaign at $1.99, taking caution to measure its effects on sales volume closely.
4. Conduct more in-depth customer feedback collection on various price points to refine our pricing strategy further.
5. Analyze competitor pricing strategies regularly to adjust accordingly while ensuring profitability.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $1.75 price provides a stable and consistent profit.
2. Price sensitivity is pronounced; any increase above $1.75 tends to decrease sales volume.
3. The $1.78 price point reveals potential for revenue growth but requires careful consideration of customer responses.
4. The $1.99 price point aligns with competitive pricing but has resulted in lower sales volume, suggesting caution in its application.
5. Implementing promotional strategies necessitates a balance to maintain profit margins; careful monitoring is essential.

My chosen price:
