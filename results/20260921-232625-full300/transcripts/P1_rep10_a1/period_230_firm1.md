Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy of $1.75 has proven to be quite effective, maintaining strong demand and generating consistent profits. However, higher pricing experimentation suggests a price sensitivity that limits potential increases. The attempts at $1.80 and $1.79 resulted in a noticeable drop in quantity sold. Meanwhile, monitoring competitor pricing indicates that the market is also quite reactive, especially with competitors pricing around $1.99. Although $1.75 remains a solid baseline, it may be beneficial to continue testing a slight reduction to $1.76 or adjustments to $1.78 to assess any potential benefits in sales volume or customer reactions. Given the historical data, $1.75 is still the best-performing price, but minor adjustments might be worthwhile for experimentation.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price of $1.75 for consistent sales data, as it maintains strong demand and profits.
2. Explore a gradual increase in price to either $1.76 or $1.78 to gauge customer response without significant volume loss.
3. Finalize and analyze the results from the trials at $1.78 and $1.79, particularly how these affect total profit.
4. Continuously monitor competitor pricing around $1.99 and adjust strategies accordingly while testing different pricing tiers.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $1.75 consistently yields strong customer demand and stable profits.
2. Price increases to $1.80 and $1.79 show significant decreases in volume sold, indicating high price sensitivity.
3. Trialing prices at $1.76 could help gauge customer reactions without major loss in sales.
4. Ongoing monitoring of competitor pricing is essential for maintaining a competitive edge, particularly with competitors around $1.99.

My chosen price:
