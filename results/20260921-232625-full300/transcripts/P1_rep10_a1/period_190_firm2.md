Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Continue selling at $2.00 to maintain strong sales volume and evaluate total profit.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely and consider introducing incentives or promotions if competition intensifies.
3. Gradually evaluate pricing increases beyond $2.00 later in the future, testing customer reactions carefully to avoid losing sales momentum.
4. Gather customer feedback on pricing sensitivity to inform potential adjustments and communicate value effectively.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The sustained price of $2.00 has demonstrated significant potential to maximize profits due to high sales volume, making it a strategic choice in a competitive landscape.
2. Price sensitivity among customers is evident, as shown by sales fluctuations with minor price increases.
3. Competitor pricing remains critical; continuous monitoring will help adjust strategies as necessary to maintain customer loyalty and support profitability.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Selling at $2.00 has consistently yielded strong sales volume, resulting in optimal profits, particularly evident in recent rounds. Lower prices, like $1.99, have attracted higher sales but resulted in lower profit per unit, while the price at $2.09 has shown stable profits but with decreased sales volume. Customer sensitivity to price is clear, especially indicated by shifts from $2.00 to $2.09. The competitive landscape also shows opportunities; however, the opponent's pricing shows some recent variation that we should watch closely. The upward limit for pricing is $3.99, and there may be potential to test higher prices with careful monitoring of reactions from customers, particularly if we can justify the price based on value through effective communication. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue selling at $2.00 for the immediate future to maintain strong sales volume and evaluate total profit.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely for strategic adjustments, especially since competitors are fluctuating around the $1.75 to $1.80 range.
3. Test a slight price increase to $2.10 or $2.19 in upcoming rounds while gathering feedback on customer reactions to assess their price sensitivity.
4. Communicate value effectively to justify price increases through promotions or enhanced product messaging.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The sustained price of $2.00 has proven effective for maximizing profits with strong sales volumes, which should be the focus currently.
2. Price sensitivity among customers is evident; minor changes have noticeable effects on sales, suggesting that consistency may benefit overall profit.
3. Competitor pricing shows some variability; therefore, continuous examination is essential for strategic price positioning, potentially allowing higher prices without losing competitiveness.

My chosen price:
2.00
