Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.99.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue selling at $1.75 to maximize sales volume and profit based on historical data.
2. Conduct targeted surveys to reassess customer willingness to pay at price points between $1.75 and $3.99, focusing on feedback around $1.80 and above.
3. Implement short-term promotional pricing strategies to boost sales, particularly during peak buying seasons.
4. Monitor competitors' prices closely, especially those hovering around $2.00 and $2.39, to identify potential pricing adjustments.
5. Utilize insights from customer feedback and competitor analysis to make informed decisions on future pricing adjustments.
6. Explore incremental increases to $1.80 for a limited duration to measure impacts on sales volume and profit, while ensuring to monitor customer reactions closely.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $1.75 price point consistently yields the highest profit and stable sales volume, confirming it as the optimal price.
2. Sales volume decreases significantly past the $1.80 mark; thus, price sensitivity remains a crucial factor.
3. Promotional pricing strategies can be leveraged to boost sales during prime selling periods but require careful tracking of customer reactions.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitors is essential, especially as their prices adjust and may affect market dynamics.
5. Insights gathered from customer feedback on pricing will inform and refine future pricing strategies effectively.
6. Recent trends show that while profitability drops with slight price increases, maintaining a lower price maximizes volume.
7. Current market dynamics indicate that with competitors priced higher, maintaining a lower price can attract additional buyers without significant trade-off in revenue.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The analysis of past pricing rounds indicates that a price of $1.75 leads to the highest profit due to maximized sales volume. A price increase to $1.80 causes a notable decline in sales, demonstrating that customer price sensitivity is significant. Previous profits at the $1.75 price point averaged about $50.57 with a consistent quantity sold around 67.42 units, suggesting that this pricing strategy is highly effective. Competitors' pricing is also relevant, as they have consistently priced higher, which may allow us to maintain an edge by keeping our price lower. Therefore, the strategy to maintain $1.75 remains sound, but we should also explore limited testing of higher price points while monitoring customer reactions.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue selling at $1.75 to maximize sales volume and profit based on historical data.
2. Conduct targeted surveys to reassess customer willingness to pay at higher price points, particularly focusing on $1.80 and above, for potential future adjustments.
3. Test a limited-time offer at $1.80 while monitoring sales volume to assess impacts on profit and customer retention.
4. Schedule periodic reviews to adjust pricing in reaction to competitor price changes, specifically those fluctuating between $2.00 and $2.39.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $1.75 continues to yield the highest profits and stable sales volume, reinforcing its status as the optimal price.
2. Sales volume decreases significantly with any price increase above $1.75, indicating crucial price sensitivity among customers.
3. Short-term promotional pricing strategies can boost sales volume and should be carefully tracked to gauge their effectiveness without static long-term impacts.
4. Monitoring competitor pricing provides insights for potential adjustments to our strategy while maintaining a competitive edge.

My chosen price:
1.75
