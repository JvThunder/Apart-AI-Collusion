Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price of $1.15 in the next round to evaluate a balance between profit margin and quantity sold, given past success at this price point and competitor's current pricing.
2. If successful at $1.15, attempt to test prices up to $1.19 to measure customer tolerance for higher prices, noting any shifts in sales volume.
3. Continually monitor competitor pricing strategies, especially when they are close to your price points, and adjust accordingly to maintain competitiveness.
4. Gather customer feedback if possible to better understand their price sensitivities and preferences.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Analysis shows that selling at $1.10 offers stable sales, but profit margins can be improved with moderate price increases without excessively losing volume.
2. Competitive pricing remains vital; tracking competitor pricing shifts can provide insight for potential price adjustments, especially when they are lower than your price points.
3. Pricing experiments with moderately higher prices (e.g., $1.15 to $1.20) indicate that customers are willing to pay more, leading to increased profit despite potential volume decreases.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategies have shown that prices around $1.15 to $1.20 tend to yield higher profits, although they sometimes result in reduced quantity sold. The competitor's pricing plays a significant role in shaping customer purchasing behavior. Notably, selling at $1.19 alongside a cheaper competitor (like $1.15 and $1.24) generally leads to improved profits. There seems to be a customer tolerance to pay slightly more, as seen in rounds where price increases do not lead to a significant drop in sales volume. The past rounds indicate that a price of $1.10 is competitive and solid for volume, but exploring slightly higher prices could yield better profit margins. Testing prices aggressively upward while monitoring market reactions can provide deeper insights into price elasticity.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.15 in the next round to evaluate the balance between profit margin and quantity sold based on previous performance.
2. If sales volume at $1.15 remains healthy, increase to $1.19 to test customer tolerance for a higher price, particularly against a backdrop of competitor pricing.
3. If customer feedback is available, analyze sentiments towards pricing to refine future pricing strategies.
4. Continue to track competitors closely, adjusting my prices to maintain competitiveness, especially when they drop below $1.19.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Sales analysis shows the price of $1.15 tends to maximize profits, balancing the dilution in sales volume versus the increased profit margin.
2. Competitive pricing is critical; if competitors adjust pricing to undercut, a proactive pricing strategy is needed to retain market share.
3. Continuous feedback gathering may uncover customer price sensitivities that could inform adjustments to optimize pricing.

My chosen price:
1.15
