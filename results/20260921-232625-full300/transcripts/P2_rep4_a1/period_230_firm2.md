Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continuously monitor competitive pricing and adjust our strategy as necessary.
2. Test the price of $1.17 again for the next round to gather more data on its impact on sales volume and profitability.
3. Further analyze the results from the previous rounds, particularly focusing on the price points of $1.10, $1.15, $1.20, and $1.22 to refine our strategies.
4. Conduct additional sensitivity analysis between $1.05 and $1.22 in upcoming rounds to gauge elasticity and determine optimal pricing.
5. Implement a short-term promotion at $1.05 to capture and analyze potential market share increases.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing at $1.10 generally boosts sales volume significantly but leads to diminished profits at lower prices.
2. Pricing at $1.15 has shown stable profit levels with slightly lower sales, leaning towards being an optimal balance.
3. Higher price points (e.g., $1.22) yield greater profits but risk compromising volume; close monitoring is crucial.
4. Customer price sensitivity is prominent in the range of $1.05 - $1.22; regular testing is key to revealing optimal pricing dynamics.
5. Observations suggest that more aggressive pricing, such as $1.05, can increase sales volume, but profit margins remain thin; careful consideration of cost and long-term strategies is necessary.
6. The behavior of customers at $1.17 continues to indicate a critical balance between volume and profit margins; further trials will provide better insights.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Through analysis of previous pricing strategies and their results, it's clear that pricing decisions significantly impact both sales volume and profitability. The recurring price points of $1.10, $1.15, and $1.20 have demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness. Particularly, $1.15 has shown the best balance between volume and profit. The price sensitivity evident in the lower price points suggests aggressive pricing at $1.05 gathers volume but comes at a significantly lower profit margin. Therefore, while it is beneficial to gather data on lower prices, we should also continue to explore higher price points to find an optimal equilibrium that maximizes profit. A cautious approach to the $1.20 and $1.22 price points will also be necessary to avoid compromising volume significantly.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continuously monitor competitive pricing and adjust our strategy as necessary.
2. Test the price of $1.15 again to gather more data on its impact on sales volume and profitability.
3. Conduct additional sensitivity analysis focusing on the price points of $1.10, $1.15, and $1.20 to refine our strategies and observe elasticity.
4. Explore the potential of a short-term promotion at a reduced price of $1.05 with careful monitoring of resultant sales and profitability.
5. Initiate a comparative analysis of the performance at $1.19 and $1.22 to find an optimal price point moving forward.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $1.10 boosts sales volume significantly but leads to diminished profits at lower prices.
2. Pricing at $1.15 has shown stable profit levels with slightly lower sales, leaning towards being an optimal balance.
3. Higher price points yield greater profits but risk compromising volume; close monitoring is crucial.
4. Customer price sensitivity is prominent in the range of $1.05 - $1.22; regular testing is essential to refine pricing dynamics.
5. Observations show that aggressive pricing (e.g., $1.05) can increase sales volume, but profit margins remain thin, necessitating a strategic long-term plan.
