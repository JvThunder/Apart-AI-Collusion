Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Continue monitoring competitive pricing to maintain a sustainable edge within the market.
2. Test $1.17 to evaluate if it maintains a strong sales volume while enhancing profits compared to $1.15.
3. Analyze the sales performance of $1.15 against its effect on quantity and profit margins to validate past observations.
4. Explore potential price points including $1.10 and $1.19 for further understanding of customer elasticity at varying competitive price scenarios.
5. Gather data on $1.22 again to analyze if it yields any profitable return on the slightly lower sales volume in past rounds.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price $1.10 generally balances strong sales volume against reasonable profit margins but needs competitor positioning evaluation.
2. Increasing price to $1.15 has shown evidence of dipping sales volume, indicating customer price sensitivity.
3. Observations suggest $1.17 may occupy a sweet spot between volume and profit worth exploring to evaluate market dynamics and elasticity.
4. Competitive pricing analysis reveals that aligning or slightly undercutting competitors (e.g., around $1.20) yields better profits than higher prices with reduced quantities sold.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Analyzing the previous price and profit data reveals several trends. The price point of $1.10 demonstrates a balance between volume and profit margin; however, it still requires competitor analysis to fully understand its effectiveness. Prices at $1.19 and $1.20 often result in lower sales volumes, suggesting customer price sensitivity. The varying performance of $1.15 shows it may be a borderline price point, with enough data indicating that both $1.10 and $1.17 could yield better outcomes. Notably, $1.05 is a lower price point that generates considerable volume but results in minimal profits due to the increased sales volume not sufficiently compensating for the price drop. 

In future pricing strategies, aligning slightly below competitors tends to yield better profits, implying that a more competitive price could lead to a higher quantity sold. Testing $1.17 again could reveal if it effectively balances volume and profit, especially since it showed promise in earlier rounds. Overall, pursuing a slightly aggressive pricing strategy may gather necessary data points for better long-term profit maximization.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue monitoring competitive pricing to maintain a sustainable edge within the market.
2. Test $1.17 again to evaluate if it strikes an optimal balance between volume and profit.
3. Analyze the price sensitivity around $1.10 and $1.15 to understand long-term buyer response.
4. Explore a riskier pricing strategy at $1.05 and observe the impact on quantity sold and profitability.
5. Consider testing prices at $1.19 and $1.20 to assess potential shifts in customer demand and competitor response.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price $1.10 generally balances strong sales volume against reasonable profit margins but needs competitor positioning evaluation.
2. Increasing price to $1.15 has shown evidence of dipping sales volume, indicating customer price sensitivity.
3. Observations suggest $1.17 may occupy a sweet spot between volume and profit worth exploring to evaluate market dynamics and elasticity.
4. Competitive pricing analysis reveals that aligning or slightly undercutting competitors yields better near-term profits than sticking to higher prices with reduced quantities sold.
5. Lowering price aggressively to $1.05 results in significant sales volume but with insufficient profit margins to be sustainable long-term.

My chosen price:
1.17
