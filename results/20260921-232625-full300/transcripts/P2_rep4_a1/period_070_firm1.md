Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Test a price of $1.10 again to confirm previous findings and evaluate sales volume.
- Continue testing the $1.19 price point alongside $1.10 to observe any shifts in volume and competitor response.
- Research and analyze customer feedback if possible to understand their price sensitivity better.
- If $1.10 yields positive results, consider a controlled increase to $1.24 to study customer limits on willingness to pay while monitoring volume changes closely.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Lower pricing strategies significantly increase sales volume but must be balanced against profit margins to ensure sustainability.
- The $1.19 price point has been a solid middle ground but shows some risk if competitors lower their prices further.
- Observations show that aggressive pricing at $1.10 provides the best sales volume, proving that customer price sensitivity is a crucial factor in maximizing sales.
- Monitoring competitor pricing closely is essential for informed pricing strategy adjustments.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The previous data indicates that aggressive pricing strategies, like setting the price at $1.10, lead to higher sales volume, while prices above $1.50 result in significantly reduced sales quantities. The price point of $1.19 has shown mixed results due to competitor pricing strategies. Testing lower price points, especially around $1.10, shows potential for maximizing profit through increased volume. However, there are saturation levels of price sensitivity, suggesting that further incremental increases may not yield better results.

In addition, testing a price of $1.24 shows promise but requires careful monitoring due to competitor responses. The overall data reflects that aggressive pricing below competitor pricing often captures greater market share, essential for long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test a price of $1.10 again to confirm previous findings and evaluate sales volume. 
- Continue testing the $1.19 price point alongside $1.10 to observe any shifts in volume and competitor response.
- Research and analyze customer feedback to understand their price sensitivity better.
- Consider a further controlled increase to $1.24 if $1.10 yields positive results, monitoring volume changes closely.
- Explore the possibility of testing a price of $1.05 to gather insights on the lower end of price sensitivity.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Lower pricing strategies significantly increase sales volume but must be balanced against profit margins for sustainability.
- The $1.19 price point has shown some risk, particularly if competitors lower prices further.
- Aggressive pricing at $1.10 provides the best sales volume, confirming critical customer price sensitivity.
- Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential for informed adjustments.
- Incremental pricing tests above $1.19 require caution as sales volume may not surpass the gains from lower pricing.

My chosen price:
1.10
