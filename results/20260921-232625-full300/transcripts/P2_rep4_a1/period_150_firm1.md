Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Test the price of $1.18 to evaluate its effects on sales volume and profitability, balancing against competitor pricing.
- Explore further aggressive pricing strategies, including testing $1.16 and $1.10 as possible alternatives.
- Continue monitoring competitor pricing, especially those below $1.19, and adjust prices reactively as needed.
- Gather data on the impact of pricing strategies in the $1.22 to $1.24 range to assess long-term profitability against sales volume.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Lower prices than competitors lead to increased sales volumes; maintaining prices close to or below $1.19 can drive market competitiveness.
- Testing pricing near $1.22 has shown a good balance between sales and profitability, but higher price points have led to reduced sales volume. Continuous exploration is required to locate the equilibrium point.
- Pricing at $1.10 consistently drives unit sales but at a lower profit margin; testing should aim to combine higher pricing with volume gains.
- Price point of $1.15 yields steady sales, but a move toward slightly lower aggressive pricing (around $1.10-$1.18) has shown promise for improved responsiveness.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy is relatively stable, with a focus on maintaining prices around $1.19 and testing variations down to $1.10. However, the market data indicates that sales volumes tend to increase with lower prices, particularly around $1.10, while higher prices yield better margins. For instance, at $1.10, the quantity sold is significantly higher but with lower profit margins compared to prices closer to $1.19. Testing aggressive pricing strategies like $1.16 and $1.18 seems promising, as they balance between sales volume and profit per unit. The consistent low sales at $1.00, despite high quantities, suggest that maintaining a rational price point above cost is crucial. Overall, it may be beneficial to incrementally test $1.18 to see if it can increase the profit while maintaining a decent volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test the price of $1.18 to evaluate its effects on sales volume and profitability, balancing against competitor pricing.
- Explore pricing strategies below $1.19, specifically $1.16, to gauge effects on market share.
- Maintain monitoring of competitor pricing, especially those below $1.19, and adjust prices reactively as needed.
- Gather data on the impact of pricing at $1.22 to $1.24 to assess long-term profitability against sales volume and consider retesting lower aggressive pricing points if necessary.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Lower prices than competitors lead to increased sales volumes; maintaining prices close to or below $1.19 can drive market competitiveness.
- Testing pricing near $1.18 has shown promise for improved responsiveness, particularly with better profit compared to $1.10 while also maintaining reasonable sales volumes.
- Pricing at $1.10 consistently drives unit sales but at a lower profit margin; testing should aim to combine higher pricing with volume gains.
- Price point of $1.15 and above yields steadily decent sales but seems to plateau, indicating the need for lower pricing explorations to spur growth.

My chosen price:
1.18
