Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

- Test a price point of $1.22 and monitor sales and profits against existing data for a comparative analysis.
- Observe the sales impact of maintaining a price of $1.24 against competitors priced at $1.20, focusing on maximizing profit while monitoring fluctuations in sales volume.
- Consider experimenting with a slight drop to $1.17 to further assess its effect on volume while starting to gather data for potential profit margins across various price points.
- Engage in continuous tracking of competitor prices to ensure optimal positioning.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

- Prices around $1.22 tend to yield a balance of sales volume and profit margins while remaining competitive.
- Maintaining a price just below competitors has consistently improved market share, especially against those pricing at $1.20 and above.
- Investigating impacts of a rounded-off price of $1.17 could further clarify price sensitivity in the market, revealing actionable data for future pricing.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The provided market data and previous rounds indicate a pattern where pricing below competitors generally drives higher sales volume, although profit margins vary. The price points of $1.22 and $1.24 have shown strong profitability with moderately high sales, particularly when competitor prices are closely monitored. The lowest price of $1.05 has also been effective in generating quantities sold but results in lower profits due to its cost structure. Evaluating the sensitivity to price adjustments, rounding down to $1.17 or testing $1.18 seems viable to assess further demand fluctuations.

New content for PLANS.txt:
- Test a price of $1.22, monitoring sales and profit levels again to validate its effectiveness in maximizing profit.
- Experiment with a price drop to $1.18 and observe its impact on sales volume and overall profit compared to higher price points.
- Maintain competitive pricing strategies by consistently analyzing competitor pricing and their reactions to our price changes.
- Conduct tests with price rounds of $1.15 and $1.17 to gather further data on customer sensitivity to these mid-range prices.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Pricing at $1.22 maintains a good balance of volume and profit margins while ensuring competitiveness in the market.
- A slight adjustment to $1.18 may yield sufficient sales to optimize profit and assess consumer price sensitivity.
- Tracking competitor prices closely can inform reactive strategies, allowing us to adapt to changes in market pricing effectively.

My chosen price:
1.22
