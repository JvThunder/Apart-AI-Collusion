Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price of $1.25 to evaluate the potential for increased sales volume and profit margin compared to the $1.30 price point.
2. Monitor the response from competitors and adjust strategy according to market feedback.
3. If sales at $1.25 are strong, further explore the impact of a temporary lower price around $1.20 to gather data on elasticity.
4. Continue to document customer feedback and maintain oversight on competitive pricing strategies for future adaptations.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Historical data shows that sales volume can significantly increase at a price of $1.25 compared to $1.30.
2. Customer behavior suggests a high sensitivity around price points, especially when competitors drop prices.
3. Analyzing long-term profitability of price reductions is essential for informing the appropriate balance between margin and volume sales in future pricing rounds.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current market data indicates that pricing at $1.50 has not yielded the best results, particularly when competitors have priced lower. The most responsive price point appears to be $1.25, where sales volumes are higher, despite lower profit margins. The competitive pricing also shows significant effects; competitors selling at lower prices have resulted in decreased sales volume for higher pricing strategies. A further exploration of elasticity by temporarily lowering the price to $1.20 could reveal valuable insights on customer sensitivity to pricing changes. It would also be prudent to maintain a close watch on competitors during this testing phase.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.20 temporarily to gauge price elasticity and potential sales volume compared to $1.25.
2. Continue to monitor competitor pricing closely as this may affect customer purchasing behavior.
3. Analyze sales data regularly to assess the impact of the price change on overall profitability and make adjustments as needed.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Historical data indicates a strong sales response at lower pricing levels, particularly at $1.25.
2. Aggressive pricing strategies, while risky, may lead to increased long-term profitability by understanding customer sensitivity to price changes and competitive dynamics.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitive pricing is essential for adapting strategies effectively in a dynamic market environment.

My chosen price:
1.20
