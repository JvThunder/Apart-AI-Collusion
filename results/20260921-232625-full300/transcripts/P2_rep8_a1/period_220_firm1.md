Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Conduct a pricing test at $1.15 to assess customer response while balancing sales volume and profit margin.
2. Implement a short-term promotion at $1.20 to evaluate its effects on volume and profit, with an eye on competitor pricing.
3. Use a promotional bundle strategy with a combined price point around $1.10 to encourage upselling while maintaining the competitive edge.
4. Gather detailed customer feedback following each promotion to analyze the effectiveness of pricing strategies.
5. Continue to track market trends and competitor adjustments closely to refine pricing strategy dynamically.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Customers show high sensitivity to price changes; lower prices typically result in increased sales, but profit margins must be carefully managed.
2. Competitive pricing is crucial for market share; periods of high pricing (e.g., $1.30 and above) correlate with declines in sales volume.
3. Promotional bundles at strategic price points enhance customer engagement and can be particularly effective during slower sales periods.
4. Maintaining a price around $1.15 to $1.20 optimizes both sales volume and profit; further tests within this range are necessary for refinement.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data, customer price sensitivity is evident, as lower prices generally lead to higher sales volumes, though they can sometimes impact profit margins negatively. Notably, price points around $1.20 resulted in reasonable sales (e.g., selling 67.11 units at $1.20 in Round 140) and upper profits (e.g., $13.42 at that price). Pricing higher than $1.20 consistently leads to decreased sales, which is problematic. Aggressive pricing strategies (such as promotional bundles or temporary lower price points) should be considered to maximize long-term profits, especially in periods of high competition. Testing pricing around $1.15 and $1.20 further appears essential, given their historical effectiveness.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Conduct a pricing test at $1.20 to analyze customer response and sales volume in comparison to competitor pricing.
2. Implement a short-term promotion at $1.15 to gauge its impact on volume and profits, given previous data indicating robust sales at this price.
3. Explore promotional bundle strategies near $1.10, focusing on methods that enhance customer engagement during sales slumps.
4. Gather detailed customer feedback and sales data for both price points following these promotions to better inform future pricing strategies.
5. Monitor competitor prices closely and adjust strategies dynamically to maintain a competitive edge in the market.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Customers exhibit high sensitivity to price changes; careful management of profit margins when lowering prices is essential.
2. Competitive pricing significantly affects market share; raising prices above $1.20 has correlated with declines in sales volume.
3. Promotional bundles priced strategically can enhance engagement and sales, especially during lower-performing sales periods.
4. Sustaining prices around $1.20 tends to optimize both sales and profit, warranting further testing within this range for fine-tuning.

My chosen price:
1.20
