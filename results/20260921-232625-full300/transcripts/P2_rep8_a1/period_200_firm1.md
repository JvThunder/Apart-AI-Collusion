Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Test a price of $1.20 for the next round; this price has previously yielded an excellent balance of volume and profit.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely; if they are at $1.10, consider also testing a price of $1.15 to see if it can yield higher volume at a slightly higher price point.
3. Once data from the $1.20 test is collected, evaluate whether to proceed with a potential incremental adjustment to $1.25 or revert back to $1.15 depending on competitive responses and sales performance.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing at $1.20 has consistently shown a favorable balance of sales volume and profit. 
2. Lower prices such as $1.10 can spur higher sales volume, but they often lead to marginal profit gains, indicating a need for strategic pricing adjustments.
3. Competitive pricing dynamics show that pricing a product closer to competitors can aid in maintaining or improving sales volume.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The recent market data shows that pricing at $1.30 has led to a consistent drop in quantity sold as competitors have lowered their pricing. Specifically, when pricing was set to $1.30, quantity sold has decreased (as low as 26.12 units) when competitors were pricing lower (e.g., $1.20 and $1.25). The price of $1.20 was more favorable in terms of sales volume, suggesting that it encourages more customers to buy. This aligns well with past insights that indicate pricing closer to competitors tends to improve sales. Therefore, testing a lower price, particularly at $1.20, along with close monitoring of competitors’ prices, could optimize both volume sold and overall profit.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.20 for the next round; this price has previously yielded an excellent balance of volume and profit.
2. Monitor competitor pricing closely; if they drop below $1.20, consider also testing a price of $1.15 or $1.10 to gauge consumer reaction.
3. Analyze sales data to determine the optimal price point between $1.10 and $1.25 based on competitor pricing and volume sold. Adjust pricing to maximize profit while maintaining competitiveness.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $1.20 has consistently shown a favorable balance of sales volume and profit, encouraging higher sales.
2. The relationship between pricing and sales volume indicates that a pricing strategy closer to competitors can significantly improve sales.
3. Testing lower prices, such as $1.15 and $1.10, in response to competitor pricing should be pursued to gather more data on demand elasticity.

My chosen price:
1.20
