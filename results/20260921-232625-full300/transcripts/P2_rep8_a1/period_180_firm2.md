Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test the price at $1.10 to evaluate its impact on sales volume and profit, while closely monitoring competitor responses.
2. Explore pricing at $1.15 to assess whether it can maintain sufficient sales volume while improving profit margins.
3. Assess the effects of introducing occasional promotional pricing at $1.05 or limited-time offers.
4. Continue monitoring competitor's pricing closely and adjust prices accordingly on a bi-weekly basis.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Recent rounds indicate that pricing at or below $1.20 strengthens sales while keeping profits in check.
2. A lower pricing strategy around $1.10 appears to maximize volume but detrimentally impacts overall profit margins.
3. Competitive pricing is crucial; being slightly below or matching competitor prices increases sales substantially.
4. Regular adjustments based on competitor pricing and overarching market trends will be essential for sustained profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the market data and the competitor’s pricing strategies, I can see that there is significant correlation between pricing my product competitively and maintaining a suitable sales volume. Prices at or below $1.20 generally boost sales but tend to squeeze profit margins. The historical rounds indicate that a price of $1.10 has previously attracted considerable sales volumes, but the resulting profits are noticeably lower. Analyzing rounds with lower prices like $1.05 shows potential for increased sales volumes, although at the expense of profit margins. I suggest continuing with an aggressive yet competitive pricing strategy, focusing on the $1.10 price range to evaluate overall sales volume against profit margins.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $1.10 to assess its impact on sales volume while monitoring competitor pricing.
2. Evaluate introducing additional promotional pricing events at $1.05 on a limited basis to gauge consumer response.
3. Monitor the effectiveness of the current pricing strategy on a weekly basis, adjusting as needed based on competitor's pricing movements.
4. Consider testing a price range between $1.00 and $1.10 to gather data on elasticity and consumer sensitivity for future pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Historical trends indicate a strong correlation between competitive pricing and higher sales volumes.
2. Each incremental increase above $1.20 leads to a significant drop in volume sold, indicating price sensitivity among consumers.
3. Lower pricing, around $1.10 and $1.05, appears to increase sales volume but can lead to lower total profits.
4. Frequent observations of competitor pricing are essential for making timely adjustments to maintain competitive advantage.

My chosen price:
1.10
