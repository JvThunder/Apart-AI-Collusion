Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price of $1.10 to assess customer retention and response particularly when competitors price at $1.15.
2. Gather additional data on customer reactions between $1.15 and $1.20 to determine if an aggressive pricing strategy might yield better profits.
3. Watch competitor pricing closely, ensuring to adjust our pricing accordingly to maintain competitiveness and boost sales when necessary.
4. Analyze sales performance data combined with customer feedback to identify optimal price settings in future rounds.
5. Continue to evaluate promotional opportunities to drive sales at lower price points, especially during market dips.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Price sensitivity is particularly high below $1.15; thus, maintaining pricing around this range seems crucial for volume.
2. Prices above $1.20 lead to opportunities for higher profit margins, albeit at a risk of volume loss.
3. Competitive pricing will continue to be a determining factor; aligning with competitors can maintain sales volume.
4. There’s a demonstrated willingness for consumers to opt for modest price increases if positioned well against competitor pricing.
5. Incremental price tests between $1.10 and $1.20 will prove useful for optimizing sales strategy.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data exhibits a clear pattern regarding price sensitivity and volume sold. Pricing around $1.10 has generally yielded consistent sales at a modest profit, especially when competitors price at similar levels. It's critical to recognize that lower prices (especially below $1.15) result in higher volumes sold, but with significantly reduced profit margins. The most successful price point appears to be $1.20, where higher profits are recorded without losing a drastic amount of volume. Testing increments above this price point may provide insight into how much customers might tolerate in terms of price. Additionally, offensive pricing strategies against competitors could help capture a larger market share.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.15 to analyze customer retention and profit margin against the competitor priced at $1.15.
2. Experiment with a higher price point of $1.20 for a couple of rounds to assess long-term profitability versus volume trade-offs.
3. Monitor competitor pricing strategies closely, particularly in response to our changes, to anticipate market shifts.
4. Evaluate customer feedback in relation to any pricing shifts to inform future strategies.
5. Consider promotional strategies at lower price points during potential sales dips in order to maintain volume.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The range between $1.10 and $1.20 consistently supports reasonable volume alongside increasing profit margins.
2. Customer sensitivity is diminished at $1.20, though market competition must be considered, as it does influence sales.
3. Competitive pricing remains a valuable strategy; lower prices tend to boost sales volume, while higher prices can optimize profits if carefully managed.
4. Customers are likely to respond positively to slight incremental changes in pricing, especially when they are competitive with alternative products.

My chosen price:
1.15
