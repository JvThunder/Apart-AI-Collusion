Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test the price at $1.20 for an extended period to confirm its stability in sales and profit.
2. Move forward with a cautious test at $1.15, as this price sits between current successful strategies and may better capture sales volume and profit.
3. Prepare to re-evaluate the $1.25 price point, even considering a long-term shift to this price if results at $1.15 indicate an upward tolerance for pricing.
4. Continue monitoring competitor pricing closely, especially as they shift around $1.10 and $1.15, to gauge how it affects our pricing strategy and customer responsiveness.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing at $1.20 has proven effective, clearly balancing sales and profit, and should be tested continuously to assess long-term viability.
2. While $1.05 leads to higher sales, it severely impacts profit margins, making it unsuitable for a sustainable long-term pricing approach.
3. The introduction of $1.15 could strike a balance that aligns with competitor pricing and maximizes profits while maintaining healthy sales volumes.
4. Being responsive to competitor pricing shifts is essential to adapt and maintain market share without sacrificing profits.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data shows that pricing strategies have varied significantly in terms of sales volume and profit margins. Prices between $1.05 and $1.20 have yielded decent sales volume, but profits have been constrained, particularly at the lower end. Notably, the price point of $1.20 has demonstrated stable sales and reasonable profits. However, prices at $1.10 have also shown solid sales volumes, despite lower profit margins. The competitor pricing dynamics suggest that customers are sensitive to slight price variations. Given these insights, testing both $1.15 and $1.20 for continued sales performance while closely monitoring competitor moves will be essential to maximize long-term profit.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test the price at $1.20 for an extended period to confirm its stability in sales and profit.
2. Execute a cautious test at $1.15 to evaluate if it captures sales volume without sacrificing too much profit.
3. Revisit the impact of competitor pricing on my sales, especially if they fluctuate around $1.10 and $1.15, and adjust pricing appropriately based on those observations.
4. Consider long-term adjustments based on outcomes from both $1.15 and $1.20 tests, aiming to identify a sweet spot for price stabilization.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Price stability at $1.20 has indicated a balance in sales and profit, warranting extended testing.
2. Prices below $1.20, particularly $1.10, have increased sales volume but reduced profit margins, thus requiring careful consideration of longer-term sustainability.
3. Strategic responses to competitor pricing are vital for maintaining market share while optimizing profitability.
4. $1.15 serves as a middle ground between capturing sales volume and ensuring decent profit margins, making it worth testing in conjunction with $1.20.

My chosen price:
1.20
