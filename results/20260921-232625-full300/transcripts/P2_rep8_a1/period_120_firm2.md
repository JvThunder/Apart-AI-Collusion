Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.24.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a pricing strategy in the $1.25 to $1.40 range to assess the trade-off between sales volume and profit margins.
2. Monitor competitors closely for any responses to this new pricing strategy.
3. Analyze the sales data weekly to adjust price points dynamically based on competitor action and sales performance.
4. Consider implementing a promotional pricing strategy at $1.25 for a limited time to gather data on customer response and potential long-term effects on volume and profit.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Pricing lower than $1.50 increases sales volume significantly, but profit margins decrease sharply; a pricing strategy must find a balance.
2. Historical data suggests higher profits per unit at around $1.60, yet competition pressures may necessitate lower pricing.
3. Consistent analysis of competitor pricing is crucial as they can significantly impact our sales dynamics.
4. Lower prices, particularly around $1.25, can significantly increase quantity sold, but profit per unit will come under pressure; careful monitoring is needed during this phase.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the historical market data, a price of $1.25 has shown potential to significantly increase sales volume while maintaining reasonable profits, as seen in Round 114 and Round 115. Setting the price at $1.25 leads to higher quantities sold (82.30 and 66.71) while still offering a reasonable profit margin. Testing the lowest prices could provide valuable data about customer sensitivity, especially if we temporarily reduce prices to levels such as $1.10 or $1.20. However, it’s also important to monitor competitor pricing closely, as they can respond quickly and affect our sales volume at these price points. Competitive pressures indicate that pricing slightly below the competitors, especially in bulk sales contexts, tends to yield higher sold quantities, albeit at lower profit margins. Thus, a strategy involving initial low pricing at $1.25, followed by potential aggressive pricing downward if necessary, may maximize long-term profits through expanded market share.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a promotional pricing strategy at $1.25 for a limited time while closely monitoring sales response and competitor actions.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of lowering prices to $1.10 or $1.20 to maximize volume sales and elasticity insights.
3. Systematically analyze competitor pricing to inform future adjustments, keeping a focus on the $1.25 to $1.60 range.
4. Collect ongoing sales and profit data weekly to adjust strategy dynamically based on performance.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $1.25 significantly boosts sales volume without drastically sacrificing profit margins, as observed in recent rounds.
2. Exploring prices between $1.10 and $1.25 may reveal customer price sensitivity and volume elasticity.
3. It is critical to remain vigilant regarding competitor pricing, especially as prices nearing the $1.50 mark can influence consumer behavior.

My chosen price:
1.25
