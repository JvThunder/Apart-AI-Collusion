Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data shows that maintaining a price of $2.00 yields the highest sales volume and profit. At this price point, the profit averages $33.33 from the consistent sale of 33.33 units. The attempts to increase the price to $2.05 have resulted in a drop in quantity sold to 29.05 and a corresponding decrease in profit, indicating that customers are more sensitive to price changes when the competitor remains at $2.00. Thus, maintaining the price at $2.00 is essential for maximizing long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to maximize sales volume and profit based on historical performance.
2. Continuously monitor sales performance at $2.00 to validate effectiveness.
3. Explore new promotional strategies to enhance customer engagement and visibility at the $2.00 price point.
4. Regularly collect and analyze customer feedback regarding pricing perception to understand its impact on demand.
5. Keep track of competitor pricing and adjust strategies as necessary to maintain a competitive edge.
6. Test limited-time promotions or bundle offers at $2.00 to gauge elasticity and potential for increased sales.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.00 leads to consistently higher sales volume (33.33 units sold) and increased profit ($33.33).
