Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.05, as it has shown consistent profitability and optimal sales volume.
2. Monitor sales data closely at this price point to ensure it remains effective.
3. Gather ongoing customer feedback to align perceived value with expectations and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
4. Continue competitive market analysis to assess pricing strategies of direct competitors.
5. Explore the potential for promotional strategies or added services that can enhance perceived value without increasing the price.
6. Execute sustained marketing initiatives focusing on the product’s value proposition to support sales at $2.05.

1. The price of $2.05 provides optimal profit margins (~$30.50) and sales volumes (~29.05 units), proving its effectiveness.
2. Higher price points (e.g., $2.10 and $2.15) correspondingly lead to decreased sales volume and profits, indicative of high customer price sensitivity.
3. The $2.05 price point effectively positions the product in the market against competitors pricing at $2.00, contributing to sustained profitability.
4. Continuous competitive pricing analysis and customer feedback are essential for ongoing success while maintaining the current pricing strategy.
5. Customer responses to promotional strategies at $2.05 should be monitored closely before making any changes to ensure they positively impact sales.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The price of $2.05 has consistently shown strong profitability and sales volume. It has become an optimal price point where sales volume is relatively stable, and it holds a competitive edge against rivals charging $2.00. Higher price points (like $2.10 and $2.15) led to reduced sales volume, indicating a sensitivity to price changes. The recent data points confirm that keeping the price at $2.05 yields a healthy profit margin. We should also consider testing alternative pricing strategies or promotional tactics tentatively, given that the maximum price customers are willing to pay is $3.34. This opens opportunities for incremental profits if executed carefully.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.05 due to its proven effectiveness in maximizing profits and maintaining sales volume.
2. Continue analyzing competitive pricing, with specific attention to fluctuations in competitor prices around $2.00.
3. Experiment with limited-time promotions at different price points (e.g., $2.10) to evaluate customer response without committing to permanent price changes.
4. Gather customer feedback on the perceived value of the product to inform potential pricing adjustments or marketing strategies.
5. Regularly assess the impact of promotional strategies on sales volume and customer engagement at the $2.05 price point.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.05 consistently results in strong profits (~$30.50) with stable sales volumes (~29.05 units).
2. The price sensitivity of customers is evident, as higher price points result in notable drops in sales volume.
3. The competition's pricing impacts customer demand; a consistent analysis of competitors offering prices at or around $2.00 is critical.
4. Future promotions should be limited-time offers to gauge customer reaction, maintaining the base price at $2.05 for stability.
5. Continuous feedback from customers will help ensure that marketing messages and pricing strategies align with customer expectations.

My chosen price:
