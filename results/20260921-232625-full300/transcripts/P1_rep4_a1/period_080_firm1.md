Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

3. Monitor competitor pricing trends regularly to stay competitive.
4. Explore promotional strategies such as temporary discounts or bundle offers to stimulate demand.
5. Test the price of $2.05 cautiously, pending positive feedback and without compromising current sales volume.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The pricing history demonstrates that maintaining a price of $2.00 yields consistent sales, with profits hovering around $42.23 in many rounds. However, resistance was noted at $2.10, which results in lower sales quantities and profits. There is potential to cautiously test a price increment to $2.05 as it has shown some profitability while capturing a decent quantity sold (averaging around 32.89). Exploring dynamic pricing based on competitor strategies could help maximize profits, especially considering competitive pricing from $2.05 to $2.75.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue maintaining the price at $2.00 to gather feedback on customer response and behavior.
2. Test the price of $2.05 to evaluate demand sensitivity and monitor sales performance.
3. Conduct a survey to further understand customer perceptions regarding price elasticity, particularly focusing on the price points of $2.05 and $2.10.
4. Continue monitoring competitor pricing and adapt offerings based on market movements.
5. Explore marketing strategies like bundle offers or limited-time discounts to enhance sales without significantly harming the base price.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.00 remains a strong baseline for profitability and stability.
- The testing of $2.05 shows promise but requires close monitoring for sales impact.
- There is a clear price resistance at $2.10, suggesting sensitivity to price increases beyond $2.05.
- Ongoing competitor analysis is paramount for informed pricing adjustments and maintaining competitiveness.

My chosen price:
2.05
