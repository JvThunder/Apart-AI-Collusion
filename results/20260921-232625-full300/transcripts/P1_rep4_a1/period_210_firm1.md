Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data indicates that pricing at $2.00 consistently maximizes profitability, with sales volume remaining stable even amidst fluctuating competitor pricing. There is notable price sensitivity, as observed with the sales volume decline when the price was raised to $2.05. The "Buy Two Get One Free" promotion has been effective in boosting sales without impacting the perceived value. However, further investigation into customer behavior during promotions and exploring new promotional offers could yield additional insights for long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to leverage its historical success in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Continue the "Buy Two Get One Free" promotion to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing sales volume.
3. Implement a close monitoring strategy for customer responses during promotional periods to gather comprehensive data on pricing sensitivity.
4. Test seasonal promotions or limited-time offers to stimulate sales while safeguarding profit margins.
5. Document and analyze findings for actionable strategies based on observed performance data and consumer responses.
6. Plan future small-scale tests for potential price adjustments while carefully gauging their impact on sales volumes.
