Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.10 for the upcoming period to maximize profit and secure stable sales volume.
2. Prepare to conduct a small experiment with a slight price increase (e.g., $2.15) for a limited time to test customer response and gauge any impacts on sales volume.
3. Continue collecting and analyzing customer feedback on their value perception at this price point.
4. Monitor competitor pricing strategies to ensure competitive positioning while maximizing profitability.
5. Regularly evaluate sales data to assess the ongoing performance of the current strategy, aiding future pricing strategies.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.10 has proven to consistently yield the highest profits and stable sales, reinforcing the strategy to uphold this price point.
2. Customers show high price sensitivity; increases above $2.10 result in significant sales volume drops, indicating a high risk associated with price hikes.
3. Ongoing customer feedback is vital for adapting pricing strategies as market conditions change.
4. Vigilant monitoring of competitor pricing is essential to mitigate the risk of losing market share during evaluative pricing periods.
5. A consistent pricing strategy at $2.10 nurtures customer loyalty, potentially enhancing long-term profitability.
6. Exploring a minimal price increase could provide insights into customer tolerance for higher pricing while keeping the primary focus on profitability.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The recent sales data shows that maintaining a price of $2.10 has consistently resulted in high profits and stable sales volume, yielding the highest profit of $27.61 across multiple rounds. Increasing the price to $2.15 resulted in a lower quantity sold due to customer price sensitivity. Customers are likely to resist any price increases over $2.10. Therefore, it's essential to remain cautious about price hikes and continue to evaluate customer reactions and market conditions. The strategy should focus on gathering more customer feedback and possibly conduct limited price experiments over a longer period to understand better how customers perceive value at different price points.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.10 for the upcoming period to maximize profit and secure stable sales volume.
2. Conduct a careful analysis of customer feedback regarding perceived value at this price point.
3. Prepare to explore a controlled price increase (e.g., to $2.15) for a limited time in a separate experiment, while closely monitoring sales volume and customer response.
4. Keep assessing competitor pricing strategies to ensure competitive positioning while maximizing profitability.
5. Review sales data regularly to inform future pricing strategies and gain insights into customer behavior.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.10 consistently yields the highest profits and stable sales, thus reinforcing the decision to uphold this price point.
2. Customers exhibit high price sensitivity, and any increases above $2.10 lead to significant declines in sales volume, indicating the risk associated with price hikes.
3. Gathering ongoing customer feedback is crucial for adapting pricing strategies in response to market changes.
4. Constant monitoring of competitors’ pricing is necessary to avoid losing market share.
5. Maintaining a consistent pricing strategy fosters customer loyalty, contributing to long-term profitability.

My chosen price:
2.10
