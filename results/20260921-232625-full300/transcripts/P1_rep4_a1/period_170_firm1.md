Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the historical data, maintaining a price of $2.00 has consistently maximized both sales volume and profit. However, instances of raising the price to $2.05 show a significant reduction in quantity sold, suggesting a strong price sensitivity among customers. The promotion strategies like "Buy Two Get One Free" have proven effective in boosting sales without sacrificing profit margins. Given that the highest quantity sold with the price of $2.00 is 39.23 at a competitive price point, there is potential to consider minimal price increments or seasonal pricing strategies.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to maximize sales volume and profit.
2. Continue executing limited-time promotions such as "Buy Two Get One Free" to incentivize bulk purchases.
3. Analyze customer feedback to refine future marketing tactics.
4. Investigate seasonal promotions to increase customer engagement and potential sales.
5. Monitor competitor pricing to ensure I remain competitive.
6. Conduct small incremental price tests below $2.05 to investigate demand elasticity, adjusting the strategy based on near-term customer responses.
7. Evaluate the effects of sales promotions on quantity sold and overall profitability.
8. Test price point adjustments at $2.10 and $2.15 to explore the maximum limits of customer price tolerance while carefully monitoring sales volume changes.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.00 has consistently maximized both the quantity sold and profit based on historical performance data.
- Price sensitivity remains a significant factor, as evidenced by reduced quantities sold at prices above $2.05.
