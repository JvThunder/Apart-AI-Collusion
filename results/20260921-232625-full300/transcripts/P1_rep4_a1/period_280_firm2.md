Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price increase to $2.10 for the next round to evaluate customer response and sales volume while monitoring competitor pricing.
2. Analyze the impact of the price change on profit margins to determine if a shift to a higher price point is feasible.
3. If sales volume decreases significantly, consider reverting to $2.05 and assess for further price adjustments in the future.
4. Continue gathering customer feedback on pricing and product perception to refine understanding of value sensitivity.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price of $2.00 has maintained stable sales and profit, indicating strong price acceptance but limiting potential profit margins.
2. A price point of $2.05 showed good profitability but revealed some price sensitivity without drastic decreases in sales volume.
3. Exploring price points of $2.10 and $2.15 highlighted how responsiveness can vary as price increases, emphasizing the necessity to track sales trends closely.
4. Continuing to gather competitor pricing data is crucial to ensure competitive positioning while maximizing profitability.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that maintaining a price of $2.00 results in steady sales of 33.33 units and consistent profits of $33.33 across numerous rounds. However, previous tests indicate that a price of $2.05 and $2.10 also produced relatively high profits, even though they resulted in lower quantities sold. The recent testing of $2.10 yielded lower sales volume but still provided reasonable profit. A potential price adjustment to $2.05 or $2.10 can be evaluated further to find an optimal price that maximizes long-term profits without excessively reducing sales volume.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $2.10 for the next round, focusing on observing the impact on sales volume and profit margins.
2. Compare the performance of $2.10 with previous results at $2.05 and determine the optimal selling price.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely for any changes and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
4. Continue collecting customer feedback on price sensitivity to refine understanding of perceived value.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price of $2.00 consistently maintained stable sales but limited profit margins.
2. The price point of $2.05 showed improved profitability with some sales volume decrease, indicating moderate price sensitivity.
3. Testing of $2.10 resulted in lower sales volume but still acceptable profits, demonstrating potential for higher pricing.
4. Continuous evaluation of competitor prices is vital to optimize profitability and market positioning.

My chosen price:
2.10
