Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Maintaining the price at $2.00 has proven to maximize sales volume and profits, yielding consistent profits of $35.48 with a stable quantity sold of 35.48 units. However, there's an increasing number of rounds where sales have dropped to 33.33 units at this price when competitors matched the price. This suggests exploring the introduction of a small price trial or complementary bundling strategies may help in higher sales volumes without significantly affecting profit margins. Additionally, continuing customer feedback surveys and monitoring competitor pricing remains vital to adapt strategies effectively. It’s important to explore potential promotions, like "Buy Two Get One Free," which have yet to be fully analyzed in the context of driving higher total profits.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue to maintain the price at $2.00 while observing sales volume and profit levels.
2. Implement the "Buy Two Get One Free" promotion and track its effect on total sales and profitability.
3. Conduct a customer feedback survey to obtain insights about value perception and price sensitivity.
4. Begin exploring bundling options and loyalty programs to maximize sales without reducing the base price.
5. Monitor competitor pricing strategies closely, especially changes around the $2.00 price point.
6. If sales consistently exceed 35 units, reassess potential for minor price adjustments based on comprehensive market analysis.
7. Experiment with limited-time promotions or discounts to create urgency among customers.
8. Evaluate the impact of loyalty programs to determine their effectiveness in enhancing customer retention and sales.
9. Continue to monitor customer responses to existing promotions to adapt strategies as needed.
10. Analyze rounds where quantity sold dropped to understand customer behavior at price competitiveness.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
