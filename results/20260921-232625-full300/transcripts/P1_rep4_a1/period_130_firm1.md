Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to leverage strong sales performance while monitoring competitor pricing.
2. Gather ongoing customer feedback to assess satisfaction and price sensitivity.
3. If market conditions remain stable, consider gradual increases to $2.05, tracking any impact on sales volume closely before implementation.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- Maintaining the price at $2.00 achieves strong, consistent sales performance.
- A pricing strategy of gradual adjustment is vital, as shifts to $2.05 previously resulted in a decrease in sales volume and profit, indicating customer price sensitivity.
- Ongoing competitor analysis is critical to ensure pricing remains competitive while maximizing profit.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data indicates that maintaining a price of $2.00 yields consistent sales of approximately 37.45 units, resulting in a profit of $37.45. Whenever the price is increased to $2.05, there has been a noticeable decline in quantity sold and overall profit. This suggests a significant price sensitivity among customers. Competitors are currently selling at $2.10, allowing some leeway for price adjustments without directly undercutting them. Thus, maintaining the price at $2.00 is advisable until we fully understand customer responses and market dynamics. Furthermore, I've observed that a shift to $2.05 usually leads to decreased sales, so gradually increasing prices should be approached with caution.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Keep the price at $2.00 to capitalize on consistent sales figures and strong profitability.
2. Continuously monitor customer feedback to gauge price sensitivity and satisfaction levels.
3. If stable conditions persist, consider testing a slight increase to $2.05 after assessing customer feedback and market trends.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- Keeping the price at $2.00 provides a reliable sales volume and profit margin.
- Price sensitivity is evident as increases to $2.05 have negatively impacted sales and profit.
- Careful monitoring of competitor pricing is essential to maintain a competitive edge without sacrificing profit.

My chosen price:
2.00
