Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Revert the price to $2.00 for the next period to stabilize sales volume and reassess customer demand following the slight price increase to $2.05.
2. Identify the optimal price range by conducting gradual tests above $2.00 without exceeding the perceived threshold of $2.05 for the next few rounds.
3. Continuously document and analyze competitor pricing to gauge market positioning and adapt strategies accordingly.
4. Engage customer feedback mechanisms to facilitate a better understanding of buying behavior at various price points.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The price of $2.05 has demonstrated potential but risks reduced volume and profit; testing lower prices for stability and retaining customer loyalty is necessary.
- The established price of $2.00 allows for a consistent customer base with potential high volume, reaffirming its viability as a baseline price.
- Demand sensitivity is pivotal; any price strategy should avoid frequent and significant fluctuations above the current threshold.
- Competitor pricing remains a critical factor influencing customer choices, highlighting the need for agile pricing strategies.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current data indicates that the price of $2.00 consistently yields substantial sales volumes and profits, often around the mid-40s in quantity sold with a profit also in the mid-40s or higher. The price increase to $2.05 resulted in a noticeable drop in sales volume, indicating a sensitivity to pricing just above $2.00. Furthermore, at the higher price points tested (like $2.25), there is evidence of decreased sales volume despite similar profit margins. Overall, the $2.00 price point appears to stabilize sales while balancing profit maximization. Additionally, customer behavior suggests a willingness to pay up to the competitive range of $2.10 to $2.15, sparking an opportunity for slight adjustments. I recommend gradually testing incremental price increases while monitoring sales closely.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Revert the price to $2.00 for another round to maintain stability and ensure consistent sales volume.
2. Gradually test price points within the range of $2.00 to $2.10 to evaluate responsiveness without crossing customer sensitivity thresholds.
3. Continuously monitor competitor pricing and document customer responses to any price adjustments to inform future decisions.
4. Collect and analyze customer feedback to gauge perceptions at different price points and refine pricing strategy.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.00 continues to provide a reliable balance between sales volume and profitability, making it a strong candidate for a baseline price going forward.
- The observed sensitivity at prices above $2.00 indicates that warrant caution while exploring price increases; customer loyalty may be jeopardized.
- A structured approach to testing prices incrementally should be conducted to identify potential thresholds before risking volume loss.
- Understanding competitor pricing dynamics is essential to preserve market competitiveness.

My chosen price:
2.00
