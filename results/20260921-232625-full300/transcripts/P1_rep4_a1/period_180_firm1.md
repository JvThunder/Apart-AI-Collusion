Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

My observations and thoughts:
Based on historical data, the price of $2.00 consistently maximizes both sales volume and profit. Increasing the price to $2.05 results in a noticeable decline in quantity sold, negatively impacting overall profitability. Additionally, promoting bulk purchases with strategies like "Buy Two Get One Free" has previously been effective in enhancing sales volume and customer retention. Therefore, I recommend maintaining the price at $2.00 while continuing to gather data and explore promotional strategies to identify opportunities for potential incremental price increases in the future without directly impairing sales.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 to maximize sales volume and profit.
2. Implement limited-time promotions such as "Buy Two Get One Free" to incentivize bulk purchases and enhance overall sales volume.

4. Conduct regular competitor pricing analysis and adjust promotional strategies as necessary to stay competitive.

6. Test seasonal promotions during peak purchasing periods while sustaining the $2.00 base price.
7. Continue evaluating potential incremental pricing adjustments above $2.00 based on data confirming customer tolerance for higher prices without significantly impacting sales.
