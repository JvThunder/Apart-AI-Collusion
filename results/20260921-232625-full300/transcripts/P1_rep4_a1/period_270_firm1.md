Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for controlled testing while monitoring key metrics.
2. Test a price of $2.05 for a slightly extended period to analyze the sales volume impact and gather customer feedback on this price point.
3. Execute promotions like "Buy Two Get One Free" while analyzing customer behavior to understand buying patterns related to these promotions.
4. Implement customer surveys assessing value perception at various price points, especially focusing on willingness to pay more than $2.00.
5. Investigate bundling strategies with other products while keeping the base price at $2.00 and measuring sales and profits relative to $2.05.
6. Continuously monitor competitor pricing and sales tactics, adjusting strategies accordingly.
7. Collect data from recent price tests to analyze trends and customer purchase behaviors at different price points.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- A consistent price of $2.00 has consistently produced optimal sales volume and profit.
- Customer price sensitivity is visible with reduced sales at $2.05; however, some customers appear willing to accept this price for the perceived value.
- Feedback gathered from customer insights will help in potential future price adjustments and understanding perceptions of value at higher prices.
- Competitor pricing strategies must be monitored continuously to stay competitive in the market.
- The exploration of bundling can enhance perceived value while potentially driving sales without losing price-sensitive customers.
- Testing at slightly elevated price points (like $2.05) has shown some promise for generating higher profit without completely alienating the customer base.
- The most recent trial of $2.10 showed increased sales volume and profitability, indicating potential for further testing, but competitive pricing should remain a consideration.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates a consistent sales volume and profit with the price set at $2.00, resulting in stable earnings over many rounds. Testing at $2.05 showed a reduction in quantity sold, but some customers seem to accept this price for perceived value. The recent price of $2.10 did lead to increased sales volume and profitability, suggesting potential in gradually raising prices. The current strategy of $2.00 continues to yield good performance, but customers seem receptive to higher prices if positioned correctly. Bundling and promotional strategies remain a key area to explore for enhancing perceived value and driving sales. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 for another testing round, while collecting customer feedback and observing metrics.
2. Test price at $2.10 for an extended period to thoroughly analyze sales volume, profit margins, and customer reactions.
3. Implement a bundling strategy at the current price of $2.00 to see if this can enhance perceived value.
4. Continue to analyze competitor pricing and adjust strategies based on their movements, particularly if they enter higher price points.
5. Transition to regular surveys and feedback mechanisms to assess customer willingness to pay at different levels, especially above $2.00.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- A consistent price of $2.00 has produced stable sales volume and profit. 
- Testing prices at $2.05 shows some customer resistance, while $2.10 demonstrated increased sales volume and profitability.
- The recent price changes reflect the responsiveness of customers to perceived value, indicating that price sensitivity may vary among different segments.
- Promotional strategies, including bundling, can enhance perceived value without alienating price-sensitive customers.
- Ongoing competitor analysis remains crucial, especially as prices start to fluctuate in the competitive landscape.

My chosen price:
