Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.34.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.00 has consistently maintained high sales volume at 35.48 units with a profit of $35.48. There is a clear price sensitivity among customers; raising the price to $2.05 resulted in a drop in quantity sold to 29.05, indicating that keeping the price at $2.00 supports the highest profit levels. Competition is stable, with competitors maintaining a price of $2.05, which allows us to remain competitive by staying at $2.00. Further exploration of promotional strategies like "Buy Two Get One Free" and potential customer feedback can refine our approach while maintaining or potentially increasing sales volume without raising the price. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 while monitoring sales volume and profit trends for stability.
2. Continue the "Buy Two Get One Free" promotion testing to evaluate its effectiveness on total sales and profitability.
3. Conduct a customer feedback survey to understand the perceived value of current pricing strategies.
4. Explore bundling options or loyalty programs as potential means of increasing sales without altering prices significantly.
5. Track competitor pricing closely to adapt and maintain a competitive edge.
