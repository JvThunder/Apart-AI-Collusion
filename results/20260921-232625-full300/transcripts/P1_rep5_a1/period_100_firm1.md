Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The pricing data suggests that the current price point of $1.85 is sustainable and maximizes profit while maintaining strong sales volume. The successful transitions between various price points indicate that while there is room for experimentation within the range, caution is necessary due to customer sensitivity to price changes. Additionally, the bundling strategies and promotional offers can be leveraged effectively without deterring the customer base. Notably, sales and profit figures show that a price increase to $1.90 or higher may risk volume decline based on historical reactions. Competitor pricing, particularly being close to our price points, requires consistent monitoring to ensure competitiveness without sacrificing our current profit margins. Ultimately, maintaining the $1.85 price while cautiously testing small increments or promotional strategies appears most beneficial for long-term profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price point of $1.85 due to its demonstrated balance of volume and profit.
2. Begin testing a small price increase to $1.90, monitoring customer feedback and sales volume closely to avoid loss.
3. Experiment with bundling products at the $1.85 price point to increase perceived value and sales.
4. Implement ongoing reviews of competitor pricing to inform strategic adjustments as needed.
5. Schedule regular analysis of customer feedback regarding pricing and perceived value to guide future adjustments.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $1.85 price point continues to demonstrate strong performance regarding both sales volume and profit margins.
2. Incremental price increases should be approached with caution due to high customer price sensitivity.
3. Bundling strategies at the current price could enhance perceived value and potentially increase customer retention.
4. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing strategies is essential to remaining competitive while sustaining profitability.
5. Aligning customer feedback with pricing adjustments can provide insights into effective pricing strategies moving forward.
