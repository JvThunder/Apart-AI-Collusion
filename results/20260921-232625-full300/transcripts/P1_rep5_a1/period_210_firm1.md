Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows a consistent pattern where the price of $1.70 has yielded the highest profit and quantity sold in several rounds, especially in Rounds 198 to 209. This pricing point also allows competitiveness, as it is still lower than the maximum price customers are willing to pay. Meanwhile, higher prices like $1.90 or even $1.85 result in diminished sales volumes. Testing slightly higher prices may provide insights, but customer sensitivity to prices should be factored in, suggesting that maintaining a price close to $1.70 is optimal for immediate and sustainable profit maximization.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $1.70 for the next round to take advantage of its proven effectiveness in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Continue monitoring competitor pricing closely, making incremental adjustments if necessary.
3. Gather customer feedback to assess perception of value and willingness to pay for potential future price adjustments.
4. Plan to test prices at $1.75 and $1.80 in subsequent rounds to further understand customer price sensitivity, while reverting to $1.70 if these tests negatively affect sales.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Pricing at $1.70 has consistently resulted in the highest sales volume and profit margins, confirming it as an optimal pricing strategy.
2. Rounds 198 to 209 reaffirmed that $1.70 maximized our profit in the current market context, highlighting the importance of competitive positioning.
3. Continuing to test $1.75 and $1.80 in the near future allows for exploration of additional pricing strategies without compromising the proven $1.70 benchmark.
4. Ongoing competitor analysis remains crucial for sustaining our competitiveness in pricing and maximizing profitability.

My chosen price:
1.70
