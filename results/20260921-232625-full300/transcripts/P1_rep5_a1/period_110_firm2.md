Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the $1.70 price point as the primary pricing strategy due to its consistent high profitability.
2. Continue testing the $1.75 price point while closely monitoring its impact on sales volume and profit.
3. Explore a further test at $1.80 if $1.75 shows positive results from the previous test.
4. Monitor customer feedback on promotional offers around the price points of $1.70 and $1.75.
5. Maintain close monitoring of competitor pricing movements to adapt swiftly to market changes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The $1.70 price point continues to yield high profitability; keeping this as a focus is essential.
2. The impact of raising prices to $1.75 should be closely analyzed to evaluate any changes in sales volume.
3. Evidence suggests customer price sensitivity; careful testing in smaller increments is recommended to avoid loss in sales.
4. Maintaining awareness of competitor pricing strategies will be crucial for positioning ourselves effectively in the market.
5. Ongoing analysis of sales data at various price points helps to understand customer behavior and improve pricing strategies.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that the $1.70 price point consistently yields high profitability, with an average profit of approximately $43.68 across many rounds. However, it is essential to continue exploring incremental price adjustments since the maximum willingness to pay is $4.09, and the market could potentially support higher prices. The testing of prices $1.75 and $1.80 is worth pursuing, as they could lead to increased profits while monitoring the impact on sales. Sales volume decreases significantly as the price approaches $2.00, indicating a price-sensitive customer base.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the $1.70 price point as the primary strategy due to its high profitability.
2. Continue testing the $1.75 price point, with a keen eye on sales volume and profitability, to see if it can outperform $1.70.
3. Begin testing the $1.80 price point if $1.75 performs positively, to gauge customer response at higher price levels.
4. Experiment with a $1.65 price point to assess if it can generate increased sales volume and analyze profitability against $1.70.
5. Keep a close eye on competitor pricing, especially as it trends below $2.00, and adjust strategies accordingly.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. $1.70 continues to demonstrate strong profitability; this will remain a focus.
2. The impact of the $1.75 and $1.80 price points is essential to test for potential higher profitability.
3. A testing strategy of slightly lower prices like $1.65 could reveal opportunities for volume increases without substantially lowering profit.
4. Competitor pricing trends should guide any strategic shifts; current market conditions indicate the value of adaptability.

My chosen price:
1.75
