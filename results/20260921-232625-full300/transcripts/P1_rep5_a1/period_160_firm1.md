Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Maintain the price at $1.80 for the upcoming round to evaluate continued sales velocity and profit margins.
2. Should sales remain steady, consider monitoring competitors closely for adjustments; evaluate potential gradual increases if justified.
3. After this round, conduct a thorough analysis of profitability and sales performance for a long-term strategy evaluation.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. The price of $1.80 consistently yields good sales volume (30-37 units) and profit margins ($24.45 - $29.95), making it a reliable short-term strategy.
2. Testing at $1.85 presented challenges with notable declines in volume against competitor pricing, indicating limited price elasticity above $1.85.
3. Competitor pricing trends remain crucial; continuous monitoring allows for competitive adjustments to maintain market position.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The data indicates that maintaining a price of $1.80 has led to steady sales and strong profits, specifically yielding sales volumes of 34 units with profits around $27.20 in recent rounds. The price elasticity seems to indicate that prices above $1.85 lead to declines in sales, suggesting that consumer demand is sensitive around that threshold. The competitor's pricing has generally been lower than mine but remains stable, allowing for a consistent customer base at $1.80. With the maximum price customers are willing to pay being $4.09, and the profitability analysis showing that lower prices yield higher volumes, a consistent pricing strategy in the $1.80 to $1.85 range appears beneficial for sustained profit maximization. Given that maintaining existing pricing at $1.80 has served well, it is advisable to continue monitoring competitor pricing while maintaining this price.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $1.80 for the upcoming rounds to evaluate continued sales velocity and profit margins.
2. Should sales remain steady, consider monitoring competitors for adjustments; evaluate potential gradual increases if warranted, staying within the $1.80 to $1.85 range.
3. Conduct a detailed profitability analysis after several rounds to finalize long-term pricing strategies. 

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Maintaining a price of $1.80 consistently yields high sales volume (34 units) and satisfactory profit margins ($27.20), establishing it as an effective long-term strategy.
2. Sales tend to decline significantly when prices exceed $1.85, indicating limited price elasticity.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential to maintain competitiveness while maximizing profit.

My chosen price:
1.80
