Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

My observations and thoughts:
The data suggests that maintaining a price of $2.00 has historically maximized profit, consistently outperforming higher prices and leading to sustainable sales volume. This price seems to strike a balance between customer demand and profitability, especially in a highly competitive environment where slight adjustments can drastically affect sales performance. The insights regarding customer price sensitivity highlight that even small increases can lead to a significant decrease in sales. Therefore, it might be prudent to continue at $2.00 while exploring additional strategies to enhance perceived value and encourage higher future pricing.
