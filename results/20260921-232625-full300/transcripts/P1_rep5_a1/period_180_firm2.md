Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $4.09.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price at $1.60 to assess the long-term impact on sales volume and overall profitability.
2. Continuously monitor competitor pricing, especially if they lower prices below $1.80, to adjust our pricing strategy if necessary.
3. Analyze customer feedback around the $1.60 price point to further understand price sensitivity and preferences.
4. Plan to test a return to $1.65 after a month of observing performance at $1.60 to evaluate potential profit versus volume outcomes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The price point of $1.65 has consistently yielded high sales volume and profits, indicating it is a strong price point for stability.
2. Testing a lower price point of $1.60 has resulted in increased sales volume, suggesting potential customer preference for this pricing level.
3. Continued monitoring of competitors' pricing is essential for maintaining a competitive edge; adjustments may be necessary if they lower prices significantly.
4. Customer sensitivity around the $1.70 threshold suggests careful consideration is needed for pricing above this level, especially when testing higher price points.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The price point of $1.65 has previously shown strong performance with high sales volume and profits, making it a solid option for stability. The recent tests at $1.60 have indicated an increase in sales volume, suggesting that customers may be more receptive to lower prices, though the profit margins at this price point have been narrower. The consistent performance of $1.70 indicates it may be a worthwhile price to maintain for steady profits but gives less sales volume than $1.65. Customer sensitivity to price suggests testing lower, but any substantial change must take competitor pricing into account, especially as they are currently hovering around $1.85. In order to maximize profit in the long run, experimenting with the $1.60 price point while keeping a close eye on sales performance can help find optimal pricing. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain a price at $1.60 for the upcoming month to assess long-term impacts on sales volume and overall profitability.
2. Monitor sales volume closely to evaluate if the lower price affects long-term customer loyalty and repeat purchases.
3. Prepare to switch back to $1.65 after the month if sales at $1.60 stabilize at a lower average profit margin.
4. Track competitor pricing and adjust accordingly if they lower prices significantly below $1.80 to remain competitive.
5. Continue gathering and analyzing customer feedback on price sensitivity as we test different price points.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $1.65 has consistently yielded high sales volume and profits, indicating it is a strong price point for stability.
2. Testing a lower price point of $1.60 has resulted in increased sales volume, suggesting potential customer preference for this pricing level.
3. Continued monitoring of competitors' pricing is essential for maintaining a competitive edge; adjustments may be necessary if they lower prices significantly.
4. Customer sensitivity around the $1.70 threshold suggests careful consideration is needed for pricing above this level, especially when testing higher price points.
5. Keeping a close watch on the balance between price and volume at lower price points will be essential for maximizing long-term profitability.

My chosen price:
