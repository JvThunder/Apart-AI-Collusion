Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.39.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Conduct a test at $1.05 for an extended period to analyze sales volume and profit, sticking to this price point for the next few rounds for stability and data collection.
2. Explore the potential of gradually increasing the price to $1.10 in subsequent rounds to gauge its impact on sales.
3. Implement a survey for customer feedback on value perception relative to the price changes once data collection initiates at $1.05.
4. Continue to analyze competitors but prepare to respond quickly to significant shifts in their pricing strategies, especially during peak sales seasons.
5. Consider a temporary promotional period below $1.00 (e.g., $0.99) as a data-gathering tactic later if current strategies yield insufficient response from customers.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. Lower price points correlate with higher sales volume, but profitability must remain the priority to avoid long-term losses.
2. Watching competitive pricing closely is vital, but too much focus on underpricing can degrade profit margins.
3. Data currently shows $1.05 may balance sales volume and profit well; more testing is necessary to validate this.
4. Engaging customers through feedback mechanisms is crucial for correlating price changes to perceived value.
5. The strategy should remain flexible to adapt to changing competitor prices while maximizing profit through long-term pricing strategies.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on previous pricing data, it seems $1.05 has been effective in balancing sales volume with profitability, while increasing the price to $1.10 has resulted in lower sales volumes but higher profit margins. The negative impact on quantity sold when increasing prices highlights the importance of price sensitivity among customers. A promotional period at $0.99 could potentially incentivize customers to buy more, but could also harm overall profitability if not carefully monitored. The most promising strategy moving forward appears to be a mixed approach that includes testing a lower price point while permanently fixing a mid-range price to gauge customer willingness to pay.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue testing the price at $1.05 for the next two rounds to stabilize data collection and analyze sales volume and profit.
2. Implement a temporary promotional price at $0.99 for one round after testing $1.05 to observe any spike in sales and customer reaction.
3. Gather customer feedback through surveys to understand perceived value at different price points, particularly focusing on the lower price moves.
4. Based on the results from the promotional period, decide on a longer-term strategy between the $1.05 and $1.10 price points, while also keeping a close eye on competitor pricing.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Observed that customers are sensitive to price changes; lower pricing strategies, such as $1.05 and below, have consistently yielded higher sales despite lower profits.
2. The effectiveness of $1.05 appears stable; however, the necessity of collecting more data regarding customer perceptions is high.
3. New strategies like temporary promotions at lower prices (e.g., $0.99) could yield valuable data about price elasticity of demand and potential increases in long-term profitability.
4. Competing effectively requires a balance between aggressive pricing and maintaining profitability—constant monitoring of competitor prices is essential for informed decision-making.

My chosen price:
1.05
