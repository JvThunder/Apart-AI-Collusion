Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes, keeping in mind that pricing lower than your competitor will typically lead to more product sold. Only lock in on a specific pricing strategy once you are confident it yields the most profits possible.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.89.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Test a price of $1.03 to evaluate the balance between quantity sold and profit.
2. Explore the effects of briefly lowering the price to $1.02, considering previous findings of increased sales at this rate.
3. Plan to revert to $1.10 if lower prices do not yield the desired profit improvement.
4. Analyze customer response to $1.04 for sustained purchasing behavior, focusing on long-term viability.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Sales at $1.03 indicate a potential peak in volume versus profit margins, suggesting a sweet spot for pricing.
2. Prices below $1.04, such as $1.01, generate significant quantities sold but yield minimal profit, indicating a trade-off scenario.
3. Consistent pricing at $1.10 results in stable profits, supporting a strategy of price testing with safety nets in place.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical sales and profit data show a strong correlation between pricing strategies and competitor behavior. In recent rounds, the price of $1.10 has consistently provided stable profits, but the volume sold is relatively low compared to lower prices. Conversely, prices around $1.02 to $1.05 generate higher sales volumes, though profits per unit are lower. The competition's price at $1.00 suggests a very price-sensitive market where small changes can lead to significant shifts in quantity sold. The profit margin at higher prices tends to stabilize, but the quantities sold indicate room for aggressive pricing strategies to test elasticity. Notably, prices near $1.03 result in a peak in volume versus profit margins. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Test a price of $1.02 to evaluate the impact on sales volume in comparison to competitors.
2. Investigate the effects of pricing at $1.03 again, as it previously indicated a potential sweet spot.
3. Consider a temporary dip to $1.01 for one round to gauge customer reaction and maximize data collection on customer sensitivity near the floor price.
4. If volume tests at lower prices yield results, plan to incrementally re-assess higher prices to find a sustainable balance between profit margins and unit sales.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Prices around $1.03 and $1.02 generate significantly higher sales volumes, indicating price elasticity in customer purchases in this range.
2. The consistent performance of the price at $1.10 suggests it serves as a reliable baseline, but there is potential for significantly higher profits through strategic reduction.
3. Overall customer behavior demonstrates that pricing below $1.04 fuels demand but tests profitability; perhaps a range of mixed strategies across pricing levels can optimize long-term profit.

My chosen price:
1.02
