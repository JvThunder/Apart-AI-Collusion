Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Retain the price at $2.00 since it has consistently yielded the highest volume of sales and profit.
2. Continue to closely monitor competitor pricing and market dynamics to ensure appropriate responses to competitor actions.
3. Review the pricing strategy every few weeks to evaluate ongoing performance and customer demand.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The price of $2.00 maximizes profit and sales volume, indicating strong customer demand at this price point.
- An increase in price above $2.00 resulted in decreased sales volume and overall profitability.
- Remain vigilant about competitive pricing, but prioritize maintaining our successful price point unless a significant shift in market conditions occurs in the future.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
- The data shows that the price of $2.00 consistently leads to the highest volume of sales and profit, with profits of $35.48 for 35.48 units sold, revealing robust customer demand at this price point.
- Lowering the price to $2.05 yields a slightly lower profit of $30.50, despite an increase in sales volume compared to higher prices. This indicates that while competitive pricing is important, keeping the price at $2.00 maximizes overall profitability.
- The price at $2.10 does show a reasonable profit of $29.62, but it is lower than that achieved at $2.00. Raising the price to $2.15 has consistently resulted in diminished sales volume and profit, suggesting that the optimal price point is indeed closer to $2.00.
- The consistent competitor pricing at or around $2.05 should be closely monitored to ensure we maintain a competitive edge without undermining our profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.00 due to its ongoing success in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Continue monitoring competitor pricing and sales trends closely to adapt and ensure competitiveness.
3. Reassess customers' willingness to pay and any changes in market dynamics bi-weekly to ensure that pricing remains optimal.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.00 has shown to maximize profit and sales consistently. 
- Any price increase leads to decreased sales volume and overall profitability.
- Monitoring of competitor pricing remains crucial, but the priority should be on maintaining the most profitable price points identified through past performance.

My chosen price:
2.00
