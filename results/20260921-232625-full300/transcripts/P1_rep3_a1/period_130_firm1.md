Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Maintain the price of $2.25 for the next pricing round to evaluate continued performance in maximizing profit and sales volume.
2. Closely monitor competitor pricing, especially if their price drops to $2.05 or below, and reassess pricing strategy if necessary, particularly for strategic pricing decisions in future rounds.
3. Gather ongoing customer feedback regarding perceived value at $2.25 to ensure continued alignment with customer perceptions and market expectations.
4. Consider testing a minor price decrement under exceptional market pressures from competitors, but establish limits to not lower prices below $2.20.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
- The price of $2.25 has consistently outperformed lower price points in both sales volume and profit margins.
- Historical data suggests that maintaining the price at $2.25 optimally balances profit margin and sales volume.
- Competitor pricing around $2.10 and any movements below that mark could pressure sales, reinforcing the need to monitor competitor strategies closely.
- Customer feedback supports the perceived value aligning well with pricing at $2.25, indicating strong acceptance at this price point.
- Pricing at $2.20 can be considered if competitive pressure shows consistent movements below this mark, but $2.25 remains the optimal price for profit maximization.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The price of $2.25 has consistently proven to maximize profit, as seen in multiple rounds where quantities sold and profits were notably higher at this price compared to $2.40 or other price points. Moreover, the previous analysis suggests that lowering the price significantly may not be beneficial given current competitor pricing trends around $2.05, which could diminish perceived value. Price elasticity appears to be lower around the $2.30-$2.40 range, indicating a preference for the $2.25 pricing strategy, particularly when competitors are at $2.10 or lower.

Given that a minor price decrement to $2.20 was tested successfully when competitors were at $2.05, this price strategy could allow for an increase in quantity sold while maintaining higher margins than the higher price points. Nonetheless, it would be prudent to maintain close monitoring of competitor pricing and customer feedback regarding perceptions of value.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price of $2.25 for the next pricing round to evaluate continued performance in maximizing profit and sales volume.
2. Test a price of $2.20 if competitor pricing remains consistently at $2.05 to capture increased sales volume while assessing profit margins.
3. Closely monitor competitor pricing, especially if their price drops further, and reassess pricing strategy if necessary, particularly for strategic decisions in future rounds.
4. Collect ongoing customer feedback regarding perceived value at $2.25 and $2.20 to ensure continued alignment with customer perceptions and market expectations.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price of $2.25 has consistently outperformed lower price points in both sales volume and profit margins.
- Historical data suggests that maintaining the price at $2.25 optimally balances profit margin and sales volume.
- Competitor pricing around $2.05 and movements below that mark could pressure sales, reinforcing the need to monitor competitor strategies closely.
- Customer feedback supports the perceived value aligning well with pricing at $2.25, indicating strong acceptance.
- Pricing at $2.20 can improve quantity sold without significantly sacrificing profit margins as demonstrated in Round 125.
- A careful balance must be maintained between profits and competitive pricing strategies to maximize long-term sustainability.

My chosen price:
2.25
