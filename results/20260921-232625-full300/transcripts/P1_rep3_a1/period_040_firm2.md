Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue selling at $2.10 to maintain established profitability and sales volume.
2. Implement another small batch trial at $2.15 to evaluate customer response to the higher price and potential impacts on sales volume.
3. Monitor customer feedback and sales data closely for the price points of $2.10 and $2.15, adjusting future strategies as necessary.
4. Analyze competitor pricing to inform continuous pricing decisions and adaptations as the market evolves.

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt

1. The price point of $2.10 continues to yield the highest consistent sales volume, averaging around 35.80 units.
2. Testing the price at $2.15 has shown that, although there is some drop in sales volume, revenue and profit margins could be optimized with more trials.
3. Customer behavior suggests a willingness to pay slightly more, indicating potential for strategic price increases.
4. Continuous competitor monitoring is essential to validate pricing strategies and customer sensitivity.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

My observations and thoughts:
The data shows that maintaining a price of $2.10 yields a consistent sales volume of approximately 35.80 units, generating a profit of $39.38. Although the price of $2.15 results in a slight decrease in quantity sold, it allows for a marginal increase in profit per unit, making it worth exploring further. The past data highlights customer willingness to pay around this range, suggesting potential for minor price adjustments without significantly affecting volume. There is also an opportunity to test higher price points, considering the maximum price customers are willing to pay is $3.35. Continuous monitoring of customer reactions and competitor pricing will be essential in determining optimal strategies moving forward.
