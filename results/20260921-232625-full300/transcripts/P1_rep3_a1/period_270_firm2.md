Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt

1. Historical data confirms that the $2.00 price point maximizes profit and sales volume at 33.33 units sold.
2. Increasing prices to $2.05 correlates with reduced sales and lower profit, reinforcing the effectiveness of maintaining the $2.00 strategy.
3. Competitors pricing at $2.00 creates a compelling reason to align pricing with the market, ensuring competitiveness.
4. Customer satisfaction at the $2.00 price point is crucial for consistent sales performance, emphasizing its importance.
5. Investigating promotional offers at the $2.00 price point may attract more customers and enhance overall market share.
6. Acknowledging the decline in sales and profits at the $2.05 price point indicates the risk of pricing above the optimal level, influencing the decision to revert to $2.00.
7. The historical consistency of sales and profits at $2.00 highlights its effectiveness as the long-term pricing strategy.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data consistently demonstrates that the $2.00 price point maximizes profit, generating a stable profit of $33.33 with a quantity sold of 33.33 units. This suggests that customers are more likely to purchase at this price compared to prices above it, which have led to declines in quantity sold and profitability. Additionally, competitor pricing strategies confirm that aligning with their prices around $2.00 enhances competitiveness. The recent rounds at $2.05 resulted in consistently lower sales, reinforcing the idea that the previous approach of maintaining the price at $2.00 is more effective for long-term profit maximization. Thus, returning to $2.00 is the most logical decision to ensure profitability moving forward.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the selling price back to $2.00 immediately to align with historical profit maximization data.
2. Monitor competitor pricing strategies continuously to ensure alignment and competitiveness at the $2.00 price point.

4. Explore promotional strategies that enhance perceived value while maintaining the $2.00 price.

6. Document and analyze customer feedback from surveys to inform possible adjustments or improvements to the product or pricing.
