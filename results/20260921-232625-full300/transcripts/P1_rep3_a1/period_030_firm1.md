Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.40 for the next round to observe if it continues to yield the highest sales and profitability.
2. Monitor customer reactions to any competitors offering lower prices (particularly around $2.10 to $2.25) that may affect our market share.
3. Consider implementing small promotions or discounts for a limited time to stimulate interest without a permanent price reduction.
4. Test bundling strategies with complementary products next to gauge impact on average order value.
5. We will revisit a modest price increase strategy after confirming continued strong performance at $2.40 and assessing competitor pricing.

- The price point of $2.40 continues to sustain the highest sales volume and profit, confirming its long-term viability.
- Previous attempts to test price increases such as $2.45 have shown a reduction in volume, indicating price sensitivity among customers.
- Competitors’ pricing, particularly near the $2.10 to $2.25 range, remains crucial to monitor as it could affect our market positioning.
- Implementing limited-time promotions may help retain customer interest and drive volume without altering the base price.
- Bundling strategies should be explored to increase the average order value without sacrificing sales volume on individual items.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.40 has consistently yielded the highest sales volume and profit, particularly when competing against prices around $2.10 to $2.25. The increase to $2.45 has shown sensitivity, causing a notable drop in units sold. Based on the recent data, customers have responded positively at the $2.40 price point, especially when competitors offer lower prices around $2.10 to $2.20. There are opportunities to further maximize profit through limited-time promotions and bundling strategies, which could enhance the perceived value without permanently changing the base price. It may also be wise to monitor any shifts in competitor pricing closely while maintaining our current pricing strategy.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.40 for the next round to continue leveraging strong sales and profitability.
2. Implement a limited-time promotional discount (e.g., $2.25 for one week) to drive volume while maintaining $2.40 as the standard price afterward.
3. Explore bundling with complementary products to increase the average order value during promotions.
4. Regularly review competitor pricing strategies, especially around the $2.10 to $2.25 range, to adjust our strategy accordingly.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price point of $2.40 remains highly effective, driving significant volume and profit.
- Price sensitivity exists at $2.45, indicating a potential ceiling for increases without sacrificing units sold.
- Promotional pricing could temporarily boost sales volumes and customer interest while preserving the standard price.
- Bundling may provide opportunities to increase overall value without eroding individual product pricing.

My chosen price:
2.40
