Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

Filename: PLANS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Set the price to $2.10 to leverage the previous successful pricing strategy and maximize customer volume.
2. Monitor sales data closely for quantity sold and profit at the $2.10 price point.
3. Gather customer feedback post-sale to assess perceived value and willingness to pay.
4. Plan to test a slight price increase to $2.15 if sales at $2.10 remain strong, to analyze demand elasticity while keeping an eye on competitor pricing.
5. Conduct a follow-up evaluation after a month to assess the impact of market conditions on pricing strategies.

- The $2.10 pricing strategy has consistently maximized profit through increased sales volume and competitive positioning.
- A price above $2.20 sees a significant drop in sales volume, indicating the price sensitivity of customers beyond that threshold.
- Recent testing of $2.15 has shown promise, with reasonable quantities sold, suggesting a viable point to explore going forward.
- Consistent monitoring of competitor pricing remains vital for maintaining an optimal competitive advantage while maximizing profits.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current pricing strategy of $2.10 maximizes sales volume and profit, as evidenced by the historical data indicating consistent quantities sold and increasing profit at this price point. The price sensitivity is noticeable, with significant drops in sales above $2.25. The recent competitive landscape shows a favorable reaction to both $2.10 and $2.15 pricing strategies. Additionally, testing a price of $2.20 has resulted in strong sales, indicating customer willingness to pay slightly higher if it remains competitive. Customer feedback should be utilized further to confirm price elasticity and perceived value.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price to $2.10 to capitalize on the previous successful pricing strategy and maintain optimal sales volume.
2. Monitor sales data closely for quantity sold and profit at the $2.10 price point.
3. Gather customer feedback post-sale to assess perceived value and willingness to pay.
4. Evaluate the potential for a price increase to $2.15 again after tracking performance over the next pricing round.
5. Conduct a follow-up evaluation after two weeks to reassess market conditions and competitor pricing strategies.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The $2.10 pricing strategy has consistently maximized profit through increased sales volume and competitive positioning.
- A price above $2.20 sees a significant drop in sales volume, indicating the price sensitivity of customers beyond that threshold.
- Recent testing of $2.15 showed reasonable quantities sold but was less effective than the $2.10 strategy.
- Implementing the $2.20 price yielded good results, especially against a $2.05 competitor's price, suggesting room for higher pricing under the right conditions.
- Continuous monitoring of the competition's pricing remains vital for avoiding underpricing and maximizing profit.

My chosen price:
2.10
