Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.10, as it has proven successful and retains steady profitability.
2. Initiate limited-time promotions at the $2.10 price point to encourage increased customer engagement and sales volume.
3. Analyze sales data and customer feedback after promotions to assess effectiveness and determine if price adjustments are warranted.
4. Conduct regular competitor price analysis to inform price strategy and stay competitive in the market.
5. Explore a slight price increase to $2.15 only after confirming that sales volume remains strong during promotional periods at $2.10.

4. Ongoing competitive analysis is crucial for timely strategic price adjustments to remain competitive.
5. Keeping the price at $2.10 supports high sales volumes, while a potential increase to $2.15 should be cautiously evaluated.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The current price of $2.10 has been consistently successful, yielding strong sales and profits while also fostering customer loyalty. According to the data, higher price points (such as $2.15 and above) have shown a decrease in sales volume and a notable price sensitivity from customers, suggesting discomfort with prices above $2.10. The profit margin remains favorable at this price point, allowing for a strategy that potentially maintains volume while also offering promotional campaigns to stimulate interest. Limited-time promotions at this price can help enhance brand loyalty and augment sales without compromising perceived value. Regular competitor analysis remains critical to ensure we are not priced out of the market.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Continue maintaining the price at $2.10, as it has proven successful with steady profitability.
2. Implement limited-time promotions at the $2.10 price point to boost customer engagement and sales volume.
3. Analyze sales data and customer feedback after promotional periods to gauge effectiveness and inform any necessary price adjustments.
4. Conduct ongoing competitor price analysis to ensure competitiveness in the market.
5. Explore opportunities to test pricing increases cautiously, evaluating sales performance at those increased levels before making permanent changes.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.10 continues to demonstrate strong sales performance and profitability.
2. Significant price sensitivity is noted beyond the $2.15 threshold, indicating customer reluctance at higher price points.
3. Limited-time promotions at $2.10 can boost sales while sustaining long-term value perception and brand loyalty.
4. Competitive analysis is essential for timely price adjustments to remain market-competitive.
5. Maintaining the price at $2.10 supports high sales volumes, while any price increase should be evaluated cautiously based on sales responses.

My chosen price:
