Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Maintain the price at $2.05 for the upcoming pricing round due to its proven effectiveness in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Continue gathering detailed customer feedback to better understand their price sensitivity and perceived value of the product.
3. Monitor competitor pricing more closely, especially those setting prices between $2.20 and $2.40, to gauge potential impacts on sales.
4. Test limited-time promotions at the $2.05 price point to assess customer response and potentially drive sales further.
5. Remain flexible in the pricing strategy, allowing for adjustments based on ongoing sales performance and competitor pricing changes.
+++++++++++++++++++++

Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Setting the price at $2.05 continues to yield optimal profitability and highest sales volume, reinforcing its value as the main price point.
2. Higher price points at or exceeding $2.15 result in lower sales, highlighting the importance of competitive pricing.
3. Continual monitoring of competitor pricing is crucial to adapt quickly to shifts that may influence our sales.
4. Actively gathering customer feedback will help in understanding price elasticity and addressing value perception.
5. Limited-time promotional strategies will be evaluated further while maintaining the core price to attract more customers.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The pricing strategy of maintaining a price at $2.05 has consistently yielded strong sales and profits. While higher prices (> $2.15) have resulted in lower quantities sold and profits, keeping the price at $2.10 has been relatively successful but does not match the profitability achieved at $2.05. Additionally, recent data suggests that maintaining competitiveness with prices below $2.25 is crucial for maximizing sales volume. The performance at $2.05 suggests strong customer acceptance and indicates potential for continued promotions and feedback mechanisms to ensure customer perception and value remain favorable. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.05 for the upcoming pricing round as it has shown to maximize both sales volume and profit consistently.
2. Continue gathering customer feedback to refine understanding of price sensitivity and perceptions of value.
3. Monitor competitor pricing closely, especially any shifts below $2.25, to preemptively adapt pricing strategies.
4. Consider the implementation of limited-time promotions at the $2.05 price point to attract more customers and boost sales.
5. Stay flexible in pricing strategy, ready to adapt based on sales performance and competitor actions.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. Maintaining the price at $2.05 continually yields optimal profitability and the highest sales volume, reinforcing its status as the primary price point.
2. Higher price points above $2.15 lead to a significant drop in sales, highlighting the need for competitive pricing.
3. Continuous monitoring of competitor pricing is essential to quickly adapt to changes that may impact sales.
4. Active customer feedback will provide insights into price elasticity and help address perceived value.
5. The success of limited-time promotional strategies at $2.05 will be further assessed to enhance customer attraction.
