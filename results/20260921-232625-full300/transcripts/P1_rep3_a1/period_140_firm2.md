Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the historical pricing data, the price point of $2.05 consistently yields the highest sales volume and profit. The flexibility shown in profits when testing slight price adjustments (like $2.10 and $2.15) suggests that customers are sensitive to pricing, with negative impacts on sales when the price rises above $2.15. Most recent rounds further reinforce the stability and profitability of maintaining the $2.05 price, especially in maintaining a competitive advantage versus competitor pricing, which typically hovers between $2.25 and $2.40.

In light of this data, I believe it is crucial to maintain the price at $2.05 for the upcoming round. Continued customer insights should further gauge the impact of promotions and price shifts while preserving profitability. While I am preparing for a controlled price increase, further testing is needed to justify any changes over $2.05 effectively.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain the price at $2.05 for the upcoming pricing round to maximize sales volume and profit based on historical performance.
2. Continue monitoring competitor pricing strategies, adjusting our pricing actions as necessary to remain competitive.
3. Test limited-time promotions and discounts around the $2.05 price to spur additional sales without exceeding profitable thresholds.
4. Assess customer feedback specific to loyalty and perceived value at the $2.05 price point to identify opportunities for future pricing adjustments.
5. Maintain a review cycle to analyze the outcomes of promotions and price experiments to support data-driven decisions.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The price point of $2.05 consistently yields optimal profitability and the highest sales volume.
2. Sales drop notably when prices rise above $2.15, highlighting the significance of maintaining competitive prices.
3. Continuous customer feedback is crucial for understanding price elasticity and increasing perceived value.
4. Maintaining pricing below perceived competitive thresholds can enhance sales performance, reinforcing the need for strategic price adjustments based on competitor behavior.
5. Testing promotions at the $2.05 level can encourage sales increases without risking customer retention.
