Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
Based on the analysis of historical sales data, maintaining the price at $2.00 has consistently resulted in maximizing sales volume and profits. At this price point, sales volume has averaged around 33.33 per round, earning a profit of approximately $33.33. In comparison, raising the price to $2.05 led to a decrease in quantity sold, staying around 29.05, with profits approximately $30.50. This highlights that while $2.05 is still within competitive range, it's not optimizing sales volume. Additionally, competitor prices suggest a consistent market for $2.00. Hence, maintaining the price at $2.00 seems the most viable strategy for sustained profitability.

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Maintain a selling price of $2.00 to leverage high sales volume and maximize profits based on historical performance.
2. Continue monitoring competitor pricing and sales volume trends to ensure competitive positioning.
3. Analyze customer feedback for value perception at the $2.00 price point to further validate the pricing strategy.
4. Conduct regular data collection and analysis to monitor the effectiveness of the pricing strategy and make timely adjustments.
5. Explore promotional strategies only if they can be implemented without reducing the price below $2.00.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
1. The $2.00 price point has consistently maximized sales volume and profits throughout historical data.
2. Prices above $2.00 lead to reduced sales volumes and profits, reinforcing the significance of the $2.00 price.
3. Maintaining the $2.00 price secures a larger market share and builds customer loyalty.
4. Continuous monitoring and data collection are essential for understanding market dynamics and informing future pricing adjustments.
5. Customer retention at the $2.00 price point is crucial, especially in a competitive environment.
6. The competitive landscape suggests that a price of $2.00 is effective in countering competitors' pricing strategies.
7. Sales performance significantly drops when prices exceed $2.00, therefore it is crucial to retain the $2.00 pricing strategy.
