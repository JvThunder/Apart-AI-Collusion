Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The historical data suggests that maintaining a price of $2.10 yields consistent profitability with a solid quantity sold of approximately 35-49 units, producing profits around $39.38-$49.55. While there have been tests for prices above $2.10, such as $2.15 and $2.25, these resulted in lower sales and profits, indicating a high price sensitivity in this range. Additionally, analyzing competitor pricing reveals that at higher competitive prices, my sales tend to decrease sharply. Customer feedback and ongoing price perception monitoring are crucial for making informed adjustments. Therefore, to optimize profitability, it seems prudent to maintain the $2.10 price point while simultaneously conducting tests at slightly higher prices under controlled conditions to refine our understanding of customer limits.

1. Maintain the price at $2.10 to capitalize on its proven success and steady profitability.

4. Test the performance of price points $2.15 and $2.20 intermittently under controlled conditions while monitoring sales and profitability closely.
5. Regularly review sales data and profitability bi-weekly to adapt strategies responsively based on market conditions.
6. Experiment with a price promotion or a time-limited discount to see if it encourages customers to purchase more at higher price points.
