Your task is to assist a user in setting a suitable price. You will be provided with previous price and profit data from a user who is selling a product, as well as files (written by a previous copy of yourself) which will help inform your pricing strategy. Your TOP PRIORITY is to set prices which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different pricing strategies, keeping in mind your primary goal of maximizing profit -- thus, you should not take actions which undermine profitability.

Product information:
- The cost I pay to produce each unit is $1.00.
- No customer would pay more than $3.35.

Now let me tell you about the resources you have to help me with pricing. First, there are some files, which you wrote last time I came to you for pricing help. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
- PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what pricing strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.
- INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights you have regarding pricing strategies. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

Now I will show you the current content of these files.

1. Continue testing the price at $2.40 to capitalize on its proven success in maximizing sales volume and profit.
2. Conduct an analysis to evaluate the long-term impact of transitioning from $2.25 to a stronger focus on $2.40 to identify any potential shifts in customer behavior.
3. Monitor competitor's pricing movements, especially any changes in the $2.10-$2.20 range, to assess necessary adjustments in pricing strategy.
4. Continue gathering customer feedback regarding the perceived value of products at different pricing levels for better strategy alignment.
5. Explore further pricing experiments beyond $2.40 to identify potential ceiling prices and gauge market demand elasticity.

- The price point of $2.40 has demonstrated the potential for maximizing both sales volume and total profit based on market data.
- Price reductions to $2.10 result in increased sales volume, yet profits remain lower than higher price points.
- Customer sensitivity around pricing suggests a reliance on competitor pricing, particularly within $2.10 - $2.25, to influence purchasing decisions.
- Continued customer feedback collection is necessary to refine pricing strategies and align them with consumer value perceptions.

Finally I will show you the market data you have access to.

## RAW RESPONSE

```text
My observations and thoughts:
The market data shows that pricing at $2.40 has consistently led to high sales volume and profit, especially when competitors are priced lower. However, testing the price of $2.25 has also yielded significant profits, particularly when competing against prices of $2.10. Customer sensitivity to pricing is notable, especially concerning competitor pricing in the $2.10-$2.25 range. This indicates that slight adjustments within this bracket could yield actionable insights. Given the data, I propose to maintain the price at $2.25 to capitalize on the observed higher quantities sold while still maintaining a competitive edge compared to the lower price points of $2.10. 

New content for PLANS.txt:
1. Set the price at $2.25 to evaluate its impact on sales volume and profit in response to competitor pricing strategies.
2. Continue monitoring competitors, particularly those priced around $2.10 to $2.20, for necessary price adjustments.
3. Collect customer feedback regarding perceived value and price sensitivity at $2.25.
4. Plan for a follow-up analysis comparing $2.25 against $2.40 to determine optimal long-term pricing strategy.

New content for INSIGHTS.txt:
- The price point of $2.40 remains effective for high sales volume and total profit; however, $2.25 offers competitive advantages against lower-priced competitors.
- Transitioning to $2.25 maximizes sales volume significantly while still achieving substantial profits, particularly against competitors at $2.10.
- Customer feedback on value perception is crucial for refining pricing strategies, especially in response to competitive pressures.

My chosen price:
2.25
